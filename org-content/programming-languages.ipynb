    "\n",
    "Programming Languages as taught by William Hawkins III\n",
    "\n",
    "pdf version is [here](pdfs/daily_pls.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "conversion didn't go as well as I hoped, but the jupyter notebook\n",

    "\n",
    "### Definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  programming language: A system of communicating computational ideas\n",
    "    between people and computing machines.\n",
    "2.  high-level programming language: A programming language that is\n",
    "    independent of any particular machine architecture.\n",
    "3.  syntax: The rules for constructing structurally valid (note: valid,\n",
    "    not correct) computer programs in a particular language.\n",
    "4.  names: A means of identifying \"entities\" in a programming language.\n",
    "5.  types: A type denotes the kinds of values that a program can\n",
    "    manipulate. (A more specific definition will come later in the\n",
    "    course).\n",
    "6.  semantics: The effect of each statement's execution on the program's\n",
    "    operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four fundamental components of every programming language:\n",
    "syntax, names, types, and semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   For your favorite programming language, attempt to explain the most\n",
    "    meaningful parts of its syntax. Think about what are valid\n",
    "    identifiers in the language, how statements are separated, whether\n",
    "    blocks of code are put inside braces, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Next, ask yourself how your favorite language handles types. Are\n",
    "    variables in the language given types explicitly or implicitly? If\n",
    "    the language is compiled, are types assigned to variables before the\n",
    "    code is compiled or as the program executes? These are issues that\n",
    "    we will discuss in detail in Module 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Finally, think about how statements in your favorite programming\n",
    "    language affect the program's execution. Does the language have\n",
    "    loops? if-then statements? function composition? goto?\n",
    "\n",

    "### The value of studying PLs\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Every new language that you learn gives you new ways to think about\n",
    "    and solve problems.\n",
    "    1.  There is a parallel here with natural languages.\n",
    "    2.  Certain written/spoken languages have words for concepts that\n",
    "        others do not.\n",
    "    3.  Linguists have said that people can only conceive ideas for\n",
    "        which there are words.\n",
    "    4.  In certain programming languages there may be constructs\n",
    "        (\"words\") that give you a power to solve problems and write\n",
    "        algorithms in new, interesting ways.\n",
    "2.  You can choose the right tool for the job.\n",
    "    -   When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\n",
    "3.  Makes you an increasingly flexible programmer.\n",
    "    -   The more you know about the concepts of programming languages\n",
    "        (and the PLs that you know) the easier it is to learn new\n",
    "        languages.\n",
    "4.  Using PLs better Studying PLs will teach you about how languages are\n",
    "    implemented. This \"awareness\" can give you insight into the \"right\n",
    "    way\" to do something in a particular language. For instance, if you\n",
    "    know that recursion and looping are equally performant and\n",
    "    computationally powerful, you can choose to use the one that\n",
    "    improves the readability of your code. However, if you know that\n",
    "    iteration is faster (and that's important for your application) then\n",
    "    you will choose that method for invoking statements repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming domains\n",
    "\n",
    "-   We write programs to solve real-world problems.\n",
    "-   The problems that we are attempting to solve lend themselves to\n",
    "    programming languages with certain characteristics.\n",
    "-   Some of those real-world problems are related to helping others\n",
    "    solve real-world problems (systems programs):\n",
    "    -   e.g., operating systems, utilities, compilers, interpreters,\n",
    "        etc.\n",
    "    -   There are a number of good languages for writing these\n",
    "        applications: C, C++, Rust, Python, Go, etc.\n",
    "-   But, most of programs are designed/written to solve actually\n",
    "    real-world problems:\n",
    "    -   scientific calculations: these applications need to be fast\n",
    "        (parallel?) and mathematically precise (work with numbers of\n",
    "        many kinds). Scientific applications were the earliest\n",
    "        programming domain and inspired the first high-level programming\n",
    "        language, Fortran.\n",
    "    -   artificial intelligence: AI applications manipulate symbols (in\n",
    "        particular, lists of symbols) as opposed to numbers. This\n",
    "        application requirement gave rise to a special type of language\n",
    "        designed especially for manipulating lists, Lisp (List\n",
    "        Processor).\n",
    "    -   world wide web: WWW applications must embed code in data (HTML).\n",
    "        Because of how WWW applications advance so quickly, it is\n",
    "        important that languages for writing these applications support\n",
    "        rapid iteration. Common languages for writing web applications\n",
    "        are PERL, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Go, etc.\n",
    "    -   business: business applications need to produce reports, process\n",
    "        character-based data, describe and store numbers with specific\n",
    "        precision (aka, decimals). COBOL has traditionally been the\n",
    "        language of business applications, although new business\n",
    "        applications are being written in other languages these days\n",
    "        (Java, the .Net languages).\n",
    "    -   machine learning: machine learning applications require\n",
    "        sophisticated math and algorithms and most developers do not\n",
    "        want to rewrite these when good alternatives are available. For\n",
    "        this reason, a language with a good ecosystem of existing\n",
    "        libraries makes an ideal candidate for writing ML programs\n",
    "        (Python).\n",
    "    -   game development: So-called AAA games must be fast enough to\n",
    "        generate lifelike graphics and immersive scenes in near-real\n",
    "        time. For this reason, games are often written in a language\n",
    "        that is expressive but generates code that is optimized, C++.\n",

    "### The John von Neumann Model of Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "-   This computing model has had more influence on the development of\n",
    "    PLs than we can imagine.\n",
    "-   There are two hardware components in this Model (the processor\n",
    "    \\[CPU\\] and the memory) and they are connected by a pipe.\n",
    "    -   The CPU pipes data and instructions (see below) to/from the\n",
    "        memory (fetch).\n",
    "    -   The CPU reads that data to determine the action to take\n",
    "        (decode).\n",
    "    -   The CPU performs that operation (execute).\n",
    "    -   Because there is only one path between the CPU and the memory,\n",
    "        the speed of the pipe is a bottleneck on the processor's\n",
    "        efficiency.\n",
    "-   The Model is interesting because of the way that it stores\n",
    "    instructions and data together in the same memory.\n",
    "-   It is different than the Harvard Architecture where programs and\n",
    "    data are stored in different memory.\n",
    "-   In the Model, every bit of data is accessible according to its\n",
    "    address.\n",
    "-   Sequential instructions are placed nearby in memory.\n",
    "    -   For instance, in\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- -->\n",
    "\n",
    "    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n",
    "      statement1;\n",
    "      statement2;\n",
    "      statement3;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "statement1, statement2 and statement3 are all stored one after the other\n",
    "in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Modern implementations of the Model make fetching nearby data fast.\n",
    "-   Therefore, implementing repeated instructions with loops is faster\n",
    "    than implementing repeated loops with recursion.\n",
    "-   **Or is it?**\n",
    "-   **This is a particular case where learning about PL will help you as\n",
    "    a programmer!**\n",

    "\n",
    "### Programming Paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A paradigm is a pattern or model. A programming paradigm is a\n",
    "    pattern of problem-solving thought that underlies a particular genre\n",
    "    of programs and languages.\n",
    "    -   According to their syntax, names and types, and semantics, it is\n",
    "        possible to classify languages into one of four categories\n",
    "        (imperative, object-oriented, functional and logic).\n",
    "    -   That said, modern researchers in PL are no longer as convinced\n",
    "        that these are meaningful categories because new languages are\n",
    "        generally a collection of functionality and features and contain\n",
    "        bits and pieces from each paradigm.\n",
    "2.  The paradigms:\n",
    "    1.  Imperative: Imperative languages are based on the centrality of\n",
    "        assignment statements to change program state, selection\n",
    "        statements to control program flow, loops to repeat statements\n",
    "        and procedures for process abstraction (a term we will learn\n",
    "        later).\n",
    "        -   These languages are most closely associated with the von\n",
    "            Neumann architecture, especially assignment statements that\n",
    "            approximate the piping operation at the hardware level.\n",
    "        -   Examples of imperative languages include C, Fortran, Cobol,\n",
    "            Perl.\n",
    "    2.  Object-oriented: Object-oriented languages are based upon a\n",
    "        combination of data abstraction, data hiding, inheritance and\n",
    "        message passing.\n",
    "        -   Objects respond to messages by modifying their internal data\n",
    "            – in other words, they become active.\n",
    "        -   The power of inheritance is that an object can reuse an\n",
    "            implementation without having to rewrite the code.\n",
    "        -   These languages, too, are closely associated with the von\n",
    "            Neumann architecture and (usually) inherit selection\n",
    "            statements, assignment statements and loops from imperative\n",
    "            programming languages. Examples of object-oriented languages\n",
    "            include Smalltalk, Ruby, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript.\n",
    "    3.  Functional: Functional programming languages are based on the\n",
    "        concept that functions are first-class objects in the language –\n",
    "        in other words, functions are just another type like integers,\n",
    "        strings, etc.\n",
    "        -   In a functional PL, functions can be passed to other\n",
    "            functions as parameters and returned from functions.\n",
    "        -   The loops and selection statements of imperative programming\n",
    "            languages are replaced with composition, conditionals, and\n",
    "            recursion in functional PLs.\n",
    "        -   A subset of functional PLs are known as pure functional PLs\n",
    "            because functions those languages have no side-effects (a\n",
    "            side-effect occurs in a function when that function performs\n",
    "            a modification that can be seen outside the function – e.g.,\n",
    "            changing a value of a parameter, changing a global variable,\n",
    "            etc).\n",
    "        -   Examples of functional languages include Lisp, Scheme,\n",
    "            Haskell, ML, JavaScript, Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- -->\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Logic: Simply put, logic programming languages are based on\n",
    "        describing what to compute and not how to compute it.\n",
    "        -   Prolog (and its variants) are really the only logic\n",
    "            programming language in widespread use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Language Evaluation Criteria (New Material Alert)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four (common) criteria for evaluating a programming language:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Readability: A metric for describing how easy/hard it is to\n",
    "    comprehend the meaning of a computer program written in a particular\n",
    "    language.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Overall simplicity: The number of basic concepts that a PL has.\n",
    "\n",
    "        1.  Feature multiplicity: Having more than one way to accomplish\n",
    "            the same thing.\n",
    "        2.  Operator overloading: Operators perform different\n",
    "            computation depending upon the context (i.e., the type of\n",
    "            the operands)\n",
    "        3.  Simplicity can be taken too far. Consider machine language.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  Orthogonality: How easy/hard it is for the constructs of a\n",
    "        language to be combined to build higher-level control and data\n",
    "        structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "        1.  Alternate definition: The mutual independence of primitive\n",
    "            operations.\n",
    "        2.  Orthogonal example: any type of entity in a language can be\n",
    "            passed as a parameter to a function.\n",
    "        3.  Non-orthogonal example: only certain entities in a language\n",
    "            can be used as a return value from a function (e.g., in\n",
    "            C/C++ you cannot return an array).\n",
    "        4.  This term comes from the mathematical concept of orthogonal\n",
    "            vectors where orthogonal means independent.\n",
    "        5.  The more orthogonal a language, the fewer exceptional cases\n",
    "            there are in the language's semantics.\n",
    "        6.  The more orthogonal a language, the slower the language: The\n",
    "            compiler/interpreter must be able to compute based on every\n",
    "            single possible combination of language constructs. If those\n",
    "            combinations are restricted, the compiler can make\n",
    "            optimizations and assumptions that will speed up program\n",
    "            execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.  Data types: Data types make it easier to understand the meaning\n",
    "        of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   e.g., the difference between `int userHappy = 0;` and\n",
    "            `bool userHappy = True;`\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.  Syntax design\n",
    "\n",
    "        1.  A PL's reserved words should make things clear. For\n",
    "            instance, it is easier to match the beginnings and endings\n",
    "            of loops in a language that uses names rather than { }s.\n",
    "        2.  The PL's syntax should evoke the operation that it is\n",
    "            performing.\n",
    "            1.  For instance, a + should perform some type of addition\n",
    "                operation (mathematical, concatenation, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Writeability\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Includes all the aspects of Readability, and\n",
    "    2.  Expressiveness: An expressive language has relatively convenient\n",
    "        rather than cumbersome way of specifying computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Reliability: How likely is it that a program written in a certain PL\n",
    "    is correct and runs without errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Type checking: a language with type checking is more reliable\n",
    "        than one without type checking; type checking is testing for\n",
    "        operations that compute on variables with incorrect types at\n",
    "        compile time or runtime.\n",
    "        -   Type checking is better done at runtime.\n",
    "        -   A strongly typed programming language is one that is always\n",
    "            able to detect type errors either at compile time or\n",
    "            runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  Exception handling (the ability of a program to intercept\n",
    "        runtime errors and take corrective action) and aliasing (when\n",
    "        two or more distinct names in a program point to the same\n",
    "        resource) affect the PL's reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.  1.  1.  1.  1.  1.  1.  1.  In truth, there are so many things\n",
    "                                    that affect the reliability of a PL.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.  The easier a PL is to read and write, the more reliable the code\n",
    "        is going to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Cost: The cost of writing a program in a certain PL is a function of\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  The cost to train programmers to use that language\n",
    "    2.  The cost of writing the program in that language\n",
    "    3.  The time/speed of execution of the program once it is written\n",
    "    4.  The cost of poor reliability\n",
    "    5.  The cost of maintenance – most of the time spent on a program is\n",
    "        in maintaining it and not developing it!\n",

    "## 8/30/2021\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we learned a more complete definition of imperative programming\n",
    "languages and studied the defining characteristics of variables.\n",
    "Unfortunately we did not get as far as I wanted during the class which\n",

    "\n",
    "### Imperative Programming Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Any language that is an abstraction of the von Neumann Architecture can\n",
    "be considered an imperative programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 calling cards of imperative programming languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  *state, assignment statements, and expressions*: Imperative programs\n",
    "    have state. Assignment statements are used to modify the program\n",
    "    state with computed values from expressions\n",
    "    1.  *state*: The contents of the computer's memory as a program\n",
    "        executes.\n",
    "    2.  *expression*: The fundamental means of specifying a computation\n",
    "        in a programming language. As a computation, they produce a\n",
    "        value.\n",
    "    3.  *assignment statement*: A statement with the semantic effect of\n",
    "        destroying a previous value contained in memory and replacing it\n",
    "        with a new value. The primary purpose of the assignment\n",
    "        statement is to have a side effect of changing values in memory.\n",
    "        As Sebesta says, \"The essence of the imperative programming\n",
    "        languages is the dominant role of the assignment statement.\"\n",
    "2.  *variables*: The abstraction of the memory cell.\n",
    "3.  *loops*: Iterative form of repetition (for, while, do … while,\n",
    "    foreach, etc)\n",
    "4.  *selection statements*: Conditional statements (if/then, switch,\n",
    "    when)\n",
    "5.  *procedural abstraction*: A way to specify a process without\n",
    "    providing details of how the process is performed. The primary means\n",
    "    of procedural abstraction is through definition of subprograms\n",
    "    (functions, procedures, methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 6 attributes of variables. Remember, though, that a variable\n",
    "is an abstraction of a memory cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  *type*: Collection of a variable's valid data values and the\n",
    "    collection of valid operations on those values.\n",
    "2.  *name*: String of characters used to identify the variable in the\n",
    "    program's source code.\n",
    "3.  *scope*: The range of statements in a program in which a variable is\n",
    "    visible. Using the yet-to-be-defined concept of binding, there is an\n",
    "    alternative definition: The range of statements where the name's\n",
    "    binding to the variable is active.\n",
    "4.  *lifetime*: The period of time during program execution when a\n",
    "    variable is associated with computer memory.\n",
    "5.  *address*: The place in memory where a variable's contents (value)\n",
    "    are stored. This is sometimes called the variable's l-value because\n",
    "    only a variable associated with an address can be placed on the left\n",

    "## 9/1/2021\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Daily PL for September 1st, 2021! As we turn the page\n",
    "from August to September, we started the month discussing variable\n",
    "lifetime and scope. Lifetime is related to the storage binding and scope\n",
    "is related to the name binding. Before we learned that new material,\n",
    "however, we went over an example of the different bindings and their\n",
    "times in an assignment statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binding Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a Python statement like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "vrb = arb + 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a binding is an association between an attribute and an\n",
    "entity. What are some of the possible bindings (and their times) in the\n",
    "statement above?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The symbol + (entity) must be bound to an operation (attribute). In\n",
    "    a language like Python, that binding can only be done at runtime. In\n",
    "    order to determine whether the operation is a mathematical addition,\n",
    "    a string concatenation or some other behavior, the interpreter needs\n",
    "    to know the type of arb which is only possible at runtime.\n",
    "2.  The numerical literal 5 (entity) must be bound to some in-memory\n",
    "    representation (attribute). For Python, it appears that the\n",
    "    interpreter chooses the format for representing numbers in memory\n",
    "    (<https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.int_info> (Links to\n",
    "    an external site.),\n",
    "    <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.float_info> (Links\n",
    "    to an external site.)) which means that this binding is done at the\n",
    "    time of language implementation.\n",
    "3.  The value (attribute) of the variables `vrb` and `arb` (entities)\n",
    "    are bound at runtime. Remember that the value of a variable is just\n",
    "    another binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not an exhaustive list of the bindings that are active for this\n",
    "statement. In particular, the variables `vrb` and `arb` must be bound to\n",
    "some address, lifetime and scope. Discussing those bindings requires\n",
    "more information about the statement's place in the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables' Storage Bindings\n",
    "\n",
    "The storage binding is related to the variable's lifetime (the time\n",
    "during which a variable is bound to memory). There are four common\n",
    "lifetimes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  static: Variable is bound to storage before execution and remains\n",
    "    bound to the same storage throughout program execution.\n",
    "    1.  Variables with static storage binding cannot share memory with\n",
    "        other variables (they need their storage throughout execution).\n",
    "    2.  Variables with static storage binding can be accessed directly\n",
    "        (in other words, their access does not require redirection\n",
    "        through a pointer) because the address of their storage is\n",
    "        constant throughout execution. Direct addressing means that\n",
    "        accesses are faster.\n",
    "    3.  Storage for variables with static binding does not need to be\n",
    "        repeatedly allocated and deallocated throughout execution – this\n",
    "        will make program execution faster.\n",
    "    4.  In C++, variables with static storage binding are declared using\n",
    "        the `static` keyword inside functions and classes.\n",
    "    5.  Variables with static storage binding are sometimes referred to\n",
    "        as history sensitive because they retain their value throughout\n",
    "        execution.\n",
    "2.  stack dynamic: Variable is bound to storage when it's declaration\n",
    "    statements are elaborated (the time when a declaration statement is\n",
    "    executed).\n",
    "    1.  Variables with stack dynamic storage bindings make recursion\n",
    "        possible because their storage is allocated anew every time that\n",
    "        their declaration is elaborated. To fully understand this point\n",
    "        it is necessary to understand the way that function invocation\n",
    "        is handled using a runtime stack. We will cover this topic next\n",
    "        week. Stay tuned!\n",
    "    2.  Variables with stack dynamic storage bindings cannot be directly\n",
    "        accessed. Accesses must be made through an intermediary which\n",
    "        makes them slower. Again, this will make more sense when we\n",
    "        discuss the typical mechanism for function invocation.\n",
    "    3.  The storage for variables with stack dynamic storage bindings\n",
    "        are constantly allocated and deallocated which adds to runtime\n",
    "        overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Variables with stack dynamic storage bindings are not history\n",
    "    sensitive.\n",
    "3.  Explicit heap dynamic: Variable is bound to storage by explicit\n",
    "    instruction from the programmer. E.g., `new` / `malloc` in C/C++.\n",
    "    1.  The binding to storage is done at runtime when these explicit\n",
    "        instructions are executed.\n",
    "    2.  The storage sizes can be customized for the use.\n",
    "    3.  The storage is hard to manage and requires careful attention\n",
    "        from the programmer.\n",
    "    4.  The storage for variables with explicit heap dynamic storage\n",
    "        bindings are constantly allocated and deallocated which adds to\n",
    "        runtime overhead.\n",
    "4.  Implicit heap dynamic: Variable is bound to storage when it is\n",
    "    assigned a value at runtime.\n",
    "    1.  All storage bindings for variables in Python are handled in this\n",
    "        way. <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/memory.html> (Links to an\n",
    "        external site.)\n",
    "    2.  When a variable with implicit heap dynamic storage bindings is\n",
    "        assigned a value, storage for that variable is dynamically\n",
    "        allocated.\n",
    "    3.  Allocation and deallocation of storage for variables with\n",
    "        implicit heap dynamic storage bindings is handled automatically\n",
    "        by the language compiler/interpreter. (More on this when we\n",

    "today that covered expressions, order of evaluation, short-circuit\n",
    "evaluation and referential transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "An *expression* is the means of specifying computations in a programming\n",
    "language. Informally, it is anything that yields a value. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `5` is an expression (value 5)\n",
    "-   `5 + 2` is an expression (value 7)\n",
    "-   Assuming `fun` is a function that returns a value, `fun()` is an\n",
    "    expression (value is the return value)\n",
    "-   Assuming `f` is a variable, `f` is an expression (the value is the\n",
    "    value of the variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain languages allow more exotic statements to be expressions. For\n",
    "example, in C/C++, the `=` operator yields a value (the value of the\n",
    "expression on the right operand). It is this choice by the language\n",
    "designer that allows a C/C++ programmer to write\n",
    "\n",
    "    int a, b, c, d;\n",
    "    a = b = c = d = 5;\n",
    "\n",
    "to initialize all four variables to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we discuss functional programming languages, we will see how many\n",
    "more things are expressions that programmers typically think are simply\n",
    "statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Order of Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers learn the associativity and precedence of operations in\n",
    "their languages. That knowledge enables them to mentally calculate the\n",
    "value of statements like 5 + 4 \\* 3 / 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "What programmers often forget to learn about their language, is the\n",
    "order of evaluation of operands. Take several of those constants from\n",
    "the previous expression and replace them with variables and function\n",
    "calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "    5 + a() * c / b()\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions abound:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Is a() executed before the value of variable c is retrieved?\n",
    "-   Is b() executed before c()?\n",
    "-   Is b() executed at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a language with *functional* side effects, the answer to these\n",
    "questions matter. Why? Consider that a could have a side effect that\n",
    "changes c. If the value of c is retrieved *before* the execution of a()\n",
    "then the expression will evaluate to a certain value and if the value of\n",
    "c is retrieved after execution of a() then the expression will evaluate\n",
    "to a different value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain languages define the order of evaluation of operands (Python,\n",
    "Java) and others do not (C/C++). There are reasons why defining the\n",
    "order is a good thing:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The programmer can depend on that order and benefit from the\n",
    "    consistency\n",
    "-   The program's readability is improved.\n",
    "-   The program's reliability is improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is at least one really good reason for not defining that\n",
    "order: optimizations. If the compiler/interpreter can move around the\n",
    "order of evaluation of those operands, it may be able to find a way to\n",
    "generate faster code!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-circuit Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages with *short-circuit evaluation* take these potential\n",
    "optimizations one step further. For a boolean expression, the compiler\n",
    "will stop evaluating the expression as soon as the result is fixed. For\n",
    "instance, in `a() && b()`, if `a()` is `false`, then the entire\n",
    "statement will always be false, no matter the value of `b()`. In this\n",
    "case, the compiler/interpreter will simply not execute `b()`. On the\n",
    "other hand, in `a() || b()` if `a()` is true, then the entire statement\n",
    "will always be true, no matter the value of `b()`. In this case, the\n",
    "compiler/interpreter will simply not execute `b()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A programmer's reliance on this type of behavior in a programming\n",
    "language is very common. For instance, this is a common idiom in C/C++:\n",
    "\n",
    "    int *variable = nullptr;\n",
    "\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    if (variable != nullptr && *variable > 5) {\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, the programmer is checking to see whether there is memory\n",
    "allocated to variable before they attempt to read that memory. This is\n",
    "defensive programming thanks to short-circuit evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Referential Transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these issues would not be a problem if programmer's wrote\n",
    "functions that did not have side effects (remember that those are called\n",
    "pure functions). There are languages that will not allow side effects\n",
    "and those languages support referential transparency: A function has\n",
    "referential transparency if its value (its output) depends only on the\n",
    "value of its parameter(s). In other words, if given the same inputs, a\n",
    "referentially transparent function always gives the same output. ​\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Subprograms\n",
    "\n",
    "A *subprogram* is a type of abstraction. It is process abstraction where\n",
    "the how of a process is hidden from the user who concerns themselves\n",
    "only with the what. A subprogram provides process abstraction by naming\n",
    "a collection of statements that define parameterized computations.​\n",
    "Again, the collection of statements determines how the process is\n",
    "implemented. Subprogram parameters give the user the ability to control\n",
    "the way that the process executes. There are three types of subprograms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Procedure: A subprogram that does not return a value.\n",
    "2.  Function: A subprogram that does return a value.\n",
    "3.  Method: A subprogram that operates with an implicit association to\n",
    "    an object; a method may or may not return a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay close attention to the book's explanation and definitions of terms\n",
    "like parameter, parameter profile, argument, protocol, definition, and\n",
    "declaration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subprograms are characterized by three facts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A subprogram has only one entry point\n",
    "2.  Only one subprogram is active at any time\n",
    "3.  Program execution returns to the caller upon completion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "*Polymorphism* allows subprograms to take different types of parameters\n",
    "on different invocations. There are two types of polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  *ad-hoc polymorphism:* A type of polymorphism where the semantics of\n",
    "    the function may change depending on the parameter types.\n",
    "2.  *parametric polymorphism*: A type of polymorphism where subprograms\n",
    "    take an implicit/explicit type parameter used to define the types of\n",
    "    their subprogram's parameters; no matter the value of the type\n",
    "    parameter, in parametric polymorphism the subprogram's semantics are\n",
    "    always the same.​\n",
    "\n",
    "Ad-hoc polymorphism is sometimes call function overloading (C++).\n",
    "Subprograms that participate in ad-hoc polymorphism share the same name\n",
    "but must have different protocols. If the subprograms' protocols and\n",
    "names were the same, how would the compiler/interpreter choose which one\n",
    "to invoke? Although a subprogram's protocol includes its return type,\n",
    "not all languages allow ad-hoc polymorphism to depend on the return type\n",
    "(e.g., C++). See the various definitions of `add` in the C++ code here:\n",
    "[subprograms.cpp](https://github.com/hawkinsw/cs3003/blob/main/subprograms/subprograms.cpp)\n",
    ". Note how they all have different protocols. Further, note that not all\n",
    "the versions of the function `add` perform an actual addition! That's\n",
    "the point of ad-hoc polymorphism – the programmer can change the meaning\n",
    "of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions that are parametrically polymorphic are sometimes called\n",
    "function templates (C++) or generics (Java, soon to be in Go, Rust). A\n",
    "parametrically polymorphic function is like the blueprint for a house\n",
    "with a variable number of floors. A home buyer may want a home with\n",
    "three stories – the architect takes their variably floored house\n",
    "blueprint and \"stamps out\" a version with three floors. Some \"new\"\n",
    "languages call this process monomorphization (Links to an external\n",
    "site.). See the definition of minimum in the C++ code here:\n",
    "[subprograms.cpp](https://github.com/hawkinsw/cs3003/blob/main/subprograms/subprograms.cpp)\n",
    ". Note how there is only one definition of the function. The associated\n",
    "type parameter is `T`. The compiler will \"stamp out\" copies of minimum\n",
    "for different types when it is invoked. For example, if the programmer\n",
    "writes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    auto m = minimum(5, 4);\n",
    "\n",
    "then the compiler will generate\n",
    "\n",
    "    int minimum(int a, int b) {\n",
    "\n",
    "     return a < b ? a : b;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coroutines\n",
    "\n",
    "Just when you thought that you were getting the hang of subprograms, a\n",
    "new kid steps on the block: coroutines. Sebesta defines coroutines as a\n",
    "subprogram that cooperates with a caller. The first time that a\n",
    "programmer uses a coroutine, they call it at which point program\n",
    "execution is transferred to the statements of the coroutine. The\n",
    "coroutine executes until it yields control. The coroutine may yield\n",
    "control back to its caller or to another coroutine. When the coroutine\n",
    "yields control, it does not cease to exist – it simply goes dormant.\n",
    "When the coroutine is again invoked – resumed – the coroutine begins\n",
    "executing where it previously yielded. In other words, coroutines have\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  multiple entry points\n",
    "2.  full control over execution until they yield\n",
    "3.  the property that only one is active at a time (although many may be\n",
    "    dormant)\n",
    "\n",
    "Coroutines could be used to write a card game. Each player is a\n",
    "coroutine that knows about the player to their left (that is, a\n",
    "coroutine). The PlayerA coroutine performs their actions (perhaps\n",
    "drawing a card from the deck, etc) and checks to see if they won. If\n",
    "they did not win, then the PlayerA coroutine yields to the PlayerB\n",
    "coroutine who performs the same set of actions. This process continues\n",
    "until a player no longer has someone to their left. At that point,\n",
    "everything unwinds back to the point where PlayerA was last resumed –\n",
    "the signal that a round is complete. The process continues by resuming\n",
    "PlayerA to start another round of the game. Because each player is a\n",
    "coroutine, it never ceased to exist and, therefore, retains information\n",
    "about previous draws from the deck. When a player finally wins, the\n",
    "process completes. To see this in code, check out\n",

    "\n",
    "Although we have not yet learned about it (we will, don't worry!), there\n",

    "defining what is a valid program.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, there is less of a consensus about how a program\n",
    "language designer formally describes the semantics of programs written\n",
    "in their language. The codification of the semantics of a program\n",
    "written in a particular is known as *formal program semantics*. In other\n",
    "words, formal program semantics are a precise mathematical description\n",

    "expressions, statements and program units of a programming language.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of defining formal program semantics is to understand and\n",
    "reason about the behavior of programs. There are many, many reasons why\n",

    "### Three Types of Formal Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three common types of formal semantics. It is important that\n",
    "you know the names of these systems, but we will only focus on one in\n",
    "this course!\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Operational Semantics: The meaning of a program is defined by how\n",
    "    the program executes on an idealized virtual machine.\n",
    "2.  Denotational Semantics: Program units \"denote\" mathematical\n",
    "    functions and those functions transform the mathematically defined\n",
    "    state of the program.\n",
    "3.  Axiomatic Semantics: The meaning of the program is based on proof\n",
    "    rules for each programming unit with an emphasis on proving the\n",
    "    correctness of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on operational semantics only!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operational Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Program State\n",
    "\n",
    "    We have referred to the state of the program throughout this course.\n",
    "    We have talked about how statements in imperative languages can have\n",
    "    side effects that affect the value of the state and we have talked\n",
    "    about how the assignment statement's raison d'etre is to change a\n",
    "    program's state. For operational semantics, we have to very\n",
    "    precisely define a program's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "    At all times, a program has a state. A state is just a function\n",
    "    whose domain is the set of defined program variables and whose range\n",
    "    is V \\* T where V is the set of all valid variable values (e.g., 5,\n",
    "    6.0, True, \"Hello\", etc) and T is the set of all valid variable\n",
    "    types (e.g., Integer, Floating Point, Boolean, String, etc). ​In\n",
    "    other words, you can ask a state about a particular variable and, if\n",
    "    it is defined, the function will return the variable's current value\n",
    "    and its type.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    is about to evaluate expression e.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Program Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "    A program step is an atomic (indivisible) change from one program\n",

    "    rules. The general form of a rule is\n",

    "    The conclusion is generally written like \\<e, σ\\> ⟶ (v, τ, σ). This\n",

    "    single step of execution of a program in configuration \\<e, σ\\>.\n",

    "### Example 1: Defining the semantics of variable access.\n",
    "\n",
    "In STIMPL, the expression to access a variable, say i, is written like\n",

    "unchanged state σ.\" In other words, the evaluation of the next step of a\n",
    "program that is about to access a value is the value and type of the\n",
    "variable being accessed and the program's state is unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write that formally!\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  State Update\n",
    "\n",
    "    How do we write down that the state is being changed? Why would we\n",
    "    want to change the state? Let's answer the second question first: we\n",
    "    want to change the state when, for example, there is an assignment\n",
    "    statement. If σ (\"i\") = (4, Integer) and then the program evaluated\n",
    "    an expression like Assign(Variable(\"i\"), IntLiteral(2)), we don't\n",
    "    want the σ\n",
    "\n",
    "    function to return (4, Integer) any more! We want it to return (2,\n",
    "    Integer). We can define that mathematically like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    This means that if you are querying the updated state for the\n",
    "    variable that was just reassigned (x), then return its new value and\n",
    "    type (m and τ ). Otherwise, just return the value that you would get\n",

    "what is the value of expression e? The premise\n",

    "tells us that the value and type of e when evaluated in state σ is v,\n",

    "during evaluation of expression e and that subsequent evaluation should\n",
    "use a new state, σ\n",
    "\n",
    "'. Our mouthful above had another important caveat: the type of the\n",
    "value to be assigned to variable x must match the type of the value\n",
    "already stored in variable x. The second premise\n",
    "\n",
    "tells us that the types match – see how the τs are the same in the two\n",
    "premises? (We use the \\* to indicate that we don't care what that value\n",
    "is!)\n",

    "### Formal Program Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous class, we discussed the operational semantics of\n",
    "variable access and variable assignment. In this class we explored the\n",
    "operational semantics of the addition operator and the if/then\n",
    "statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A Quick Review of Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "    At all times, a program has a state. A state is just a function\n",
    "    whose domain is the set of defined program variables and whose range\n",
    "    is V \\* T where V is the set of all valid variable values (e.g., 5,\n",
    "    6.0, True, \"Hello\", etc) and T is the set of all valid variable\n",
    "    types (e.g., Integer, Floating Point, Boolean, String, etc). ​In\n",
    "    other words, you can ask a state about a particular variable and, if\n",
    "    it is defined, the function will return the variable's current value\n",
    "    and its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here is the formal definition of the state function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The state function is denoted with the σ . τ always represents some\n",
    "    arbitrary variable type. Generally, v represents a value. So, you\n",
    "    can read the definition above as \"Variable x has value v and type τ\n",
    "    in state σ.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Between execution steps, a program is always in a particular\n",
    "    configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "    This notation means that the program in state σ is about to evaluate\n",
    "    expression e.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A program step is an atomic (indivisible) change from one program\n",
    "    configuration to another. Operational semantics defines steps using\n",
    "    rules. The general form of a rule is\n",
    "\n",
    "    The conclusion is generally written like \\<e, σ\\> ⟶ (v, τ, σ) which\n",
    "    means that when the premises hold, the expression e evaluated in\n",
    "    state σ evaluates to a value (v), type (τ) and (possibly modified)\n",
    "    state (σ') after a single step of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Defining the Semantics of the Addition Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "    In STIMPL, the expression to \"add\" two values n1 and n2 is written\n",
    "    like Add(n1, n2). By the rules of the STIMPL language, for an\n",
    "    addition to be possible, n1 and n2 must\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  have the same type and\n",
    "    2.  have Integer, Floating Point or String type.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Because every unit in STIMPL has a value, we will define the\n",
    "    operational semantics using two arbitrary expressions, e1 and e2.\n",
    "    The program configuration to which we are giving semantics is\n",
    "\n",
    "    Because our addition operator applies when its operands are three\n",
    "    different types, we technically need three different rules for its\n",
    "    evaluation. Let's start with the operational semantics for add when\n",
    "    its operands are of type Integer:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let's look at the premises. First, there is\n",
    "\n",
    "    which means that, when evaluated in state σ, expression e1 has the\n",
    "    value v1 and type Integer and may modify the state (to σ'). Notice\n",
    "    that we are not using τ for the resulting type of the evaluation?\n",
    "    Why? Because using τ indicates that this rule applies when the\n",
    "    evaluation of e1 in state σ evaluates to any type (which we \"assign\"\n",
    "    to τ in case we want to use it again in a later premise). Instead,\n",
    "    we are explicitly writing Integer which indicates that this rule\n",
    "    only defines the operational semantics for Add(e1, e2) in state σ\n",
    "    when the expression e1 evaluates to a value of type Integer in state\n",
    "    σ\n",
    "\n",
    "    .\n",
    "\n",
    "    As for the second premise\n",
    "\n",
    "    we see something very similar. Again, our premise prescribes that,\n",
    "    when evaluated in state σ' (note the ' there), e2's type is an\n",
    "    Integer. It is for this reason that we can be satisfied that this\n",
    "    rule only applies when the types of the Add's operands match and are\n",
    "    integers! We \"thread through\" the (possibly) modified σ' when\n",
    "    evaluating e2 to enforce the STIMPL language's definition that\n",
    "    operands are evaluated strictly left-to-right.\n",
    "\n",
    "    As for the conclusion,\n",
    "\n",
    "    shows the value of this expression. We will assume here that + works\n",
    "    as expected for two integers. Because the operands are integers, we\n",
    "    can definitively write that the type of the addition will be an\n",
    "    integer, too. We use σ'' as the resulting state because it's\n",
    "    possible that evaluation of the expressions of both e1 and e2 caused\n",
    "    side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The rule that we defined covers only the operational semantics for\n",
    "    addition of two integers. The other cases (for floating-point and\n",
    "    string types) are almost copy/paste.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now, how does that translate to an actual implementation?\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    def evaluate(expression, state):\n",
    "      match expression:\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "\n",
    "      case Add(left=left, right=right):\n",
    "          result = 0\n",
    "          left_result, left_type, new_state = evaluate(left, state)\n",
    "          right_result, right_type, new_state = evaluate(right, new_state)\n",
    "\n",
    "          if left_type != right_type:\n",
    "            raise InterpTypeError(f\"\"\"Mismatched types for Add:\n",
    "                Cannot add {left_type} to {right_type}\"\"\")\n",
    "\n",
    "          match left_type:\n",
    "            case Integer() | String() | FloatingPoint():\n",
    "              result = left_result + right_result\n",
    "            case _:\n",
    "              raise InterpTypeError(f\"\"\"Cannot add {left_type}s\"\"\")\n",
    "\n",
    "          return (result, left_type, new_state)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this snippet, the local variables left and right are the\n",
    "    equivalent of e1 and e2, respectively, in the operational semantics.\n",
    "    After initializing a variable to store the result, the evaluation of\n",
    "    the premises is accomplished. new<sub>state</sub> matches σ'' after\n",
    "    being assigned and reassigned in those two evaluations. Next, the\n",
    "    code checks to make sure that the types of the operands matches.\n",
    "    Finally, if the types of the operands is an integer, then the result\n",
    "    is just a traditional addition (+ in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can see the implementation for the other types mixed in this\n",
    "    code as well. Convince yourself that the code above handles all the\n",
    "    different cases where an Add is valid in STIMPL.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Defining the Semantics of the If/Then/Else Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "    In STIMPL, we write an If/Then/Else expression like If(c, t, f)\n",
    "    where c is any boolean-typed expression, t is the expression to\n",
    "    evaluate if the value of c is true and f is the expression to\n",
    "    evaluate if the value of c is false. The value/type/updated state of\n",
    "    the entire expression is the value/type/updated state that results\n",
    "    from evaluating t when c is true and the value/type/updated state\n",
    "    that results from evaluating f when c is false. This means that we\n",
    "    are required to write two different rules to completely define the\n",
    "    operational semantics of the If/Then/Else expression: one for the\n",
    "    case where c is true and the other for the case when c is false.\n",
    "    Sounds like the template that we used for the Add expression,\n",
    "    doesn't it? Because the two cases are almost the same, we will only\n",
    "    go through writing the rule for when the condition is true:\n",
    "\n",
    "    As in the premises for the operational semantics of the Add\n",
    "    operator, the first premise in the operational semantics above uses\n",
    "    literals to guarantee that the rule only applies in certain cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    means that the rule only applies when c, evaluated in state σ, has a\n",
    "    value of True and a boolean type. We use the second premise\n",
    "\n",
    "    to \"get\" some values that we will use in the conclusion. v and τ are\n",
    "    the value and the type, respectively, of t when it is evaluated in\n",
    "    state σ'. Note that we evaluate t in state σ' because the evaluation\n",
    "    of the condition statement may have modified state σ and we want to\n",
    "    thread that through. Evaluation of t in state σ' may modify σ',\n",
    "    generating σ''. The combination of these premises are combined to\n",
    "    define that the entire expression evaluates to\n",
    "\n",
    "    Again, the pattern is the same for writing the operational semantics\n",
    "    when the condition is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let's look at how this translates into actual working code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    def evaluate(expression, state):\n",
    "      match expression:\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "\n",
    "        case If(condition=condition, true=true, false=false):\n",
    "          condition_value, condition_type, new_state = evaluate(condition, state)\n",
    "\n",
    "          if not isinstance(condition_type, Boolean):\n",
    "            raise InterpTypeError(\"Cannot branch on non-boolean value!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "          result_value = None\n",
    "          result_type = None\n",
    "\n",
    "          if condition_value:\n",
    "            result_value, result_type, new_state = evaluate(true, new_state)\n",

    "          return (result_value, result_type, new_state)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",

    "As we conclude the penultimate week of September, we are turning the\n",
    "page from imperative programming and beginning our work on\n",
    "object-oriented programming!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Definitions of Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "We started off by attempting to describe object-oriented programming\n",
    "using two different definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A language with support for abstraction of abstract data types\n",
    "    (ADTs).​ (from Sebesta)\n",
    "2.  A language with support for objects, containers of data (attributes,\n",
    "    properties, fields, etc.) and code (methods).​ (from Wikipedia\n",
    "    (Links to an external site.))\n",
    "\n",
    "As graduates of CS1021C and CS1080C, the second definition is probably\n",
    "not surprising. The first definition, however, leaves something to be\n",
    "desired. Using Definition (1) means that we have to a) know the\n",
    "definition of abstraction and abstract data types and b) know what it\n",
    "means to apply abstraction to ADTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction (Reprise)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two fundamental types of abstractions in programming: process\n",
    "and data. We have talked about the former but the latter is new. When we\n",
    "talked previously about process abstractions, we did attempt to define\n",
    "the term abstraction but it was not satisfying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sebesta formally defines abstraction as the view or representation of an\n",
    "entity that includes only the most significant attributes. This\n",
    "definition seems to align with our notion of abstraction especially the\n",
    "way we use the term in phrases like \"abstract away the details.\" It\n",
    "didn't feel like a good definition to me until I thought of it this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider that you and I are both humans. As humans, we are both carbon\n",
    "based and have to breath to survive. But, we may not have the same color\n",
    "hair. I can say that I have red hair and you have blue hair to point out\n",
    "the significant attributes that distinguish us. I need not say that we\n",
    "are both carbon based and have to breath to survive because we are both\n",
    "human and we have abstracted those facts into our common humanity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We returned to this point at the end of class when we described how\n",
    "inheritance is the mechanism of object-oriented programming that\n",
    "provides abstraction over ADTs. Abstract Data Types (ADTs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we talked about the second form of abstraction available to\n",
    "programmers: data abstraction. As functions, procedures and methods are\n",
    "the syntactic and semantic means of abstracting processes in programming\n",
    "languages, ADTs are the syntactic and semantic means of abstracting data\n",
    "in programming languages. ADTs combine (encapsulate) data (usually\n",
    "called the ADT's attributes, properties, etc) and operations that\n",
    "operate on that data (usually called the ADT's methods) into a single\n",
    "entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed that hiding is a significant advantage of ADTs. ADTs hide\n",
    "the data being represented and allow that data's manipulation only\n",
    "through pre-defined methods, the ADT's interface. The interface\n",
    "typically gives the ADT's user the ability to manipulate/access the data\n",
    "internal to the type and perform other semantically meaningful\n",
    "operations (e.g., sorting a list).\n",
    "\n",
    "We brainstormed some common ADTs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Stack\n",
    "2.  Queue\n",
    "3.  List\n",
    "4.  Array\n",
    "5.  Dictionary\n",
    "6.  Graph\n",
    "7.  Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "These are are so-called user-defined ADTs because they are defined by\n",
    "the user of a programming language and composed of primitive data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we tackled the question of whether primitives are a type of ADT. A\n",
    "primitive type like floating point numbers would seem to meet the\n",
    "definition of an abstract data type:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  It's underlying representation is hidden from the user (the\n",
    "    programmer does not care whether FPs are represented according to\n",
    "    IEEE754 or some other specification)\n",
    "2.  There are operations that manipulate the data (addition,\n",
    "    subtraction, multiplation, division).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Requirements of an Object-Oriented Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "ADTs are just one of the three requirements that your textbook's author\n",
    "believes are required for a language to be considered object oriented.\n",
    "Sebesta believes that, in addition to ADTs, an object-oriented\n",
    "programming language requires support for inheritance and dynamic method\n",
    "binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is inheritance where OOPs provide abstraction for ADTs.\n",
    "    Inheritance allows programmers to abstract ADTs into common classes\n",
    "    that share common characteristics. Consider three ADTs that we\n",
    "    identified: trees, linked lists and graphs. These three ADTs all\n",
    "    have nodes (of some kind or another) which means that we could\n",
    "    abstract them into a common class: node-based things. A graph would\n",
    "    inherit from the node-based things ADT so that its implementer could\n",
    "    concentrate on what makes it distinct – its edges, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Don't worry if that is too theoretical. It does not negate the fact\n",
    "    that, through inheritance, we are able to implement hierarchies that\n",
    "    can be \"read\" using \"is a\" the way that inheritance is usually\n",
    "    defined. With inheritance, cats inherit from mammals and \"a cat is a\n",
    "    mammal\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    Subclasses inherit from ancestor classes. In Java, ancestor classes\n",
    "    are called superclasses and subclasses are called, well, subclasses.\n",
    "    In C++, ancestor classes are called base classes and subclasses are\n",
    "    called derived classes. Subclasses inherit both data and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Dynamic Method Binding\n",
    "\n",
    "    In an OOP, a variable that is typed as Class A can be assigned\n",
    "    anything that is actually a Class A or subclass thereof. We have not\n",
    "    officially covered this yet, but in OOP a subclass can redefine a\n",
    "    method defined in its ancestor.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Assume that every mammal can make a noise. That means that every dog\n",
    "    can make a noise just like every cat can make a noise. Those noises\n",
    "    do not need to be the same, though. So, a cat \"overrides\" the\n",
    "    mammal's default noise and implements their own (meow). A dog does\n",
    "    likewise (bark). A programmer can define a variable that holds a\n",
    "    mammal and that variable can contain either a dog or a cat. When the\n",
    "    programmer invokes the method that causes the mammal to make noise,\n",
    "    then the appropriate method must be called depending on the actual\n",
    "    type in the variable at the time. If the mammal held a dog, it would\n",
    "    bark. If the mammal held a cat, it would meow.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This resolution of methods at runtime is known as dynamic method\n",
    "    binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  OOP Example with Inheritance and Dynamic Method Binding\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` java\n",
    "    abstract class Mammal {\n",

    "        System.out.println(\"meow\");\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public class MammalDemo {\n",
    "      static void makeARuckus(Mammal m) {\n",
    "        m.makeNoise();\n",
    "      }\n",
    "      public static void main(String args[]) {\n",
    "        Dog fido = new Dog();\n",
    "        Cat checkers = new Cat();\n",

    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This code creates a hierarchy with Mammal at the top as the\n",
    "    superclass of both the Dog and the Cat. In other words, Dog and Cat\n",
    "    inherit from Mammal. The abstract keyword before class Mammal\n",
    "    indicates that Mammal is a class that cannot be directly\n",
    "    instantiated. We will come back to that later. The Mammal class\n",
    "    declares that there is a method that each of its subclasses must\n",
    "    implement – the makeNoise function. If a subclass of Mammal fails to\n",
    "    implement that function, it will not compile. The good news is that\n",
    "    Cat and Dog do both implement that function and define behavior in\n",
    "    accordance with their personality!\n",
    "\n",
    "    The function makeARuckus has a parameter whose type is a Mammal. As\n",
    "    we said above, in OOP that means that I can assign to that variable\n",
    "    a Mammal or anything that inherits from Mammal. When we call\n",
    "    makeARuckus with an argument whose type is Dog, the function relies\n",
    "    of dynamic method binding to make sure that the proper makeNoise\n",
    "    function is called – the one that barks – even though makeARuckus\n",
    "    does not know whether m is a generic Mammal, a Dog or a Cat. It is\n",
    "    because of dynamic method binding that the code above generates\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` example\n",

    "\n",
    "### Overriding in OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the concept of inheritance that we discussed in the last class.\n",
    "Besides its utility as a formalism that describes the way a language\n",
    "supports abstraction of ADTs (and, therefore, makes it a plausibly OO\n",
    "language), inheritance provides a practical benefit in software\n",
    "engineering. Namely, it allows developers to build hierarchies of types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchies are composed of pairs of classes – one is the superclass and\n",
    "the other is the subclass. A superclass could conceivably be itself a\n",
    "subclass. A subclass could itself be a superclass. In terms of a family\n",
    "tree, we could say that the subclass is a descendant of the superclass\n",
    "(Note: remember that the terms superclass and subclass are not always\n",
    "the ones used by the languages themselves; C++ refers to them as base\n",
    "and derived classes, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "A subclass inherits both the data and methods from its superclass(es).\n",
    "However, as Sebesta says, \"… the features and capabilities of the\n",
    "\\[superclass\\] are not quite right for the new use.\" Overriding methods\n",
    "allows the programmer to keep most of the functionality of the baseclass\n",
    "and customize the parts that are \"not quite right.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "An overridden method is defined in a subclass and replaces the method\n",
    "with the same name (and usually protocol) in the parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The official documentation and tutorials for Java describe overriding in\n",
    "the language this way:[\"An instance method in a subclass with the same\n",
    "signature (name, plus the number and the type of its parameters) and\n",
    "return type as an instance method in the superclass overrides the\n",

    "Assume that ϕ(t) is some provable property that is true of t, an object\n",
    "of type T. Then ϕ(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "must be true as well for s, an object of type S.\n",
    "\n",
    "This formal definition can be phrased simply in terms of behaviors: If\n",
    "it is possible to pass objects of type T as arguments to a function that\n",
    "expects objects of type S without any change in the behavior, then S is\n",
    "a subtype of T. In other words, a subtype behaves exactly like the\n",

    "Barbara Liskov who pioneered the definition and study of subtypes put it\n",
    "this way (Links to an external site.): \"If for each object o1 of type S\n",
    "there is an object o2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in\n",
    "terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for\n",
    "o2, then S is a subtype of T.\"\n",

    "### A Different Way to OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have talked about OOP in the context of Java. Java, and\n",
    "languages like it, are called Class-based OOP languages. In a\n",
    "Class-based OOP, classes and objects exist in different worlds. Classes\n",
    "are used to define/declare\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  the attributes and methods of an encapsulation, and\n",
    "2.  the relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "From these classes, objects are instantiated that contain those\n",
    "attributes and methods and respect the defined/declared hierarchy. We\n",
    "can see this in the example given above: The classes Parent and Child\n",
    "define (no) attributes and (no) methods and define the relationship\n",
    "between them. In main(), a Child is instantiated and stored in the\n",
    "variable c. c is an object of type Child that contains all the data\n",
    "associated with a Child and a Parent and can perform all the actions of\n",
    "a Child and a Parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing about Class-based OOP should be different than what you've\n",
    "learned in the past as you've worked with C++. There are several\n",
    "problems with Class-based OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The supported attributes and method of each class must be determined\n",
    "    before the application is developed (once the code is compiled and\n",
    "    the system is running, an object cannot add, remove or modify its\n",
    "    own methods or attributes);\n",
    "2.  The inheritance hierarchy between classes must be determined before\n",
    "    the application is developed (once the code is compiled, changing\n",
    "    the relationship between classes will require that the application\n",
    "    be recompiled!).\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, Class-based OOP does not allow the structure of the\n",
    "Classes (nor their relationships) to easily evolve with the\n",
    "implementation of a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another way, though. It's called Prototypal OOP. The most\n",
    "commonly known languages that use Prototypal OOP are JavaScript and\n",
    "Ruby! In Prototypal (which is a very hard word to spell!) OOP there is\n",
    "no distinction between Class and object – everything is an object! In a\n",
    "Prototypal OOP there is a base object that has no methods or data\n",
    "attributes and every object is able to modify itself (its attributes and\n",
    "methods). To build a new object, the programmer simply copies from an\n",
    "existing object, the new object's so-called prototype, and customizes\n",
    "the copied object appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assume that there is an object called Car that has one\n",
    "attribute (the number of wheels) and one method (start). That object can\n",
    "serve as the prototype car. To \"instantiate\" a new Car, the programmer\n",
    "simply copies the existing prototypical car object Car and gives it a\n",
    "name, say, c. The programmer can change the value of c's number of\n",
    "wheels and invoke its method, start. Let's say that the same programmer\n",
    "wants to create something akin to a subclass of Car. The programmer\n",
    "would create a new, completely fresh object (one that has no methods or\n",
    "attributes), name it, say, Tesla, and link the new prototype Tesla\n",
    "object to the existing prototype car Car object through the prototype\n",
    "Tesla object's prototype link (the sequence of links that connects\n",
    "prototype objects to one another is called a prototype chain). If a\n",
    "Tesla has attributes (range, etc) or methods (self<sub>drive</sub>) that\n",
    "the prototype car does not, then the programmer would install those\n",
    "methods on the prototype Tesla Tesla. Finally, the programmer would\n",
    "\"declare\" that the Tesla object is a prototype Tesla.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](attachment:images/pl/4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The blue arrows in the diagram above are prototype links. The orange\n",
    "lines indicate where a copy is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does inheritance work in such a model? Well, it's actually pretty\n",
    "straightforward: When a method is invoked or an attribute is\n",
    "read/assigned, the runtime will search the prototype chain for the first\n",
    "prototypical object that has such a method or attribute. Mic drop. In\n",
    "the diagram above, let's follow how this would play out when the\n",
    "programmer calls start() on the Model 3 Instance. The Model 3 Instance\n",
    "does not contain a method named start. So, up we go! The Tesla Prototype\n",
    "Object does not contain that me either. All the way up! The Car\n",
    "Prototype Object, does, however, so that method is executed!\n",
    "\n",
    "What would it look like to override a function? Again, relatively\n",
    "straightforward. If a Tesla performs different behavior than a normal\n",
    "Car when it starts, the programmer creating the Tesla Prototype Object\n",
    "would just add a method to that object with the name start. Then, when\n",
    "the prototype chain is traversed by the runtime looking for the method,\n",
    "it will stop at the start method defined in the Tesla Prototype Object\n",
    "instead of continuing on to the start method in the Car Prototype\n",
    "Object. (The same is true of attributes!)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is (at least) one really powerful feature of this model. Keep in\n",
    "mind that the prototype objects are real things that can be manipulated\n",
    "at runtime (unlike classes which do not really exist after compilation)\n",
    "and prototype objects are linked together to achieve a type of\n",
    "inheritance. With reference to the diagram above, say the programmer\n",
    "changes the definition of the start method on the Car Prototype Object.\n",
    "With only that change, any object whose prototype chain includes the Car\n",
    "Prototype Object will immediately have that new functionality (where it\n",
    "is not otherwise overridden, obviously) – all without stopping the\n",
    "system!! How cool is that?\n",
    "\n",
    "How scary is that? Can you imagine working on a system where certain\n",
    "methods you \"inherit\" change at runtime?\n",
    "\n",
    "![](attachment:images/pl/1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### OOP or Interfaces?\n",
    "\n",
    "Newer languages (e.g., Go, Rust, (new versions of) Java) are\n",
    "experimenting with new features that support one of the \"killer apps\" of\n",
    "OOP: The ability to define a function that takes a parameter of type A\n",
    "but that works just the same as long as it is called with an argument\n",
    "whose type is a subtype of A. The function doesn't have care whether it\n",
    "is called with an argument whose type is A or some subtype of A because\n",
    "the language's OOP semantics guarantee that anything the programmer can\n",
    "do with an object of type A, the programmer can do with and object of\n",
    "subtype of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, using OOP to accomplish such a feat may be like killing a\n",
    "fly with a bazooka (or a laptop, like Alex killed that wasp today).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, modern languages are using a slimmer mechanism known as an\n",
    "interface or a trait. An interface just defines a list of methods that\n",
    "an implementer of that interface must support. Let's see some real Go\n",

    "  fmt.Printf(\"Reading the book %v\\n\", book.title)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This function only accepts arguments that implement (i.e., meet the\n",
    "criteria specified in the definition of) the Readable interface. In\n",
    "other words, with this definition, the code in the body of the function\n",
    "can safely assume that it can can call Read on r. And, for the encore:\n",

    "WhatAreYouReading because it implements the Read method which,\n",
    "implicitly, means that it implements the Readable interface. But, what's\n",
    "really cool is that the programmer never had to say explicitly that Book\n",
    "implements the Readable interface! The compiler checks automatically.\n",
    "This gives the programmer the ability to generate a list of only the\n",
    "methods absolutely necessary for its parameters to implement to achieve\n",
    "the necessary ends – and nothing unnecessary. Further, it decouples the\n",
    "person implementing a function from the person using the function –\n",
    "those two parties do not have to coordinate requirements beforehand.\n",

    "We continued the discussion of pointers that we started on Friday! On\n",
    "Friday we discussed that pointers are just like any other type – they\n",
    "have valid values and defined operations that the programmer can perform\n",
    "on those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The Pros of Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "    Though a very famous and influential computer scientist (Links to an\n",
    "    external site.) once called his invention of null references a\n",
    "    \"billion dollar mistake\" (he low balled it, I think!), the presence\n",
    "    and power of pointers in a language is important for at least two\n",
    "    reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Without pointers, the programmer could not utilize the power of\n",
    "        indirection.\n",
    "    2.  Pointers give the programmer the power to address and manage\n",
    "        heap-dynamic memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Indirection gives the programmer the power to link between different\n",
    "    objects in memory – something that makes writing certain data\n",
    "    structures (like trees, graphs, linked lists, etc) easier.\n",
    "    Management of heap-dynamic memory gives the programmer the ability\n",
    "    to allocate, manipulate and deallocate memory at runtime. Without\n",
    "    this power, the programmer would have to know before execution the\n",
    "    amount of memory their program will require.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The Cons of Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "    Their use as a means of indirection and managing heap-dynamic memory\n",
    "    are powerful, but misusing either can cause serious problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Possible Problems when Using Pointers for Indirection\n",
    "\n",
    "        As we said in the last lecture, as long as a pointer targets\n",
    "        memory that contains the expected type of object, everything is\n",
    "        a-okay. Problems arise, however, when the target of the pointer\n",
    "        is an area in memory that does not contain an object of the\n",
    "        expected type (including garbage) and/or the pointer targets an\n",
    "        area of memory that is inaccessible to the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "        The former problem can arise when code in a program writes to\n",
    "        areas of memory beyond their control (this behavior is usually\n",
    "        an error, but is very common). It can also arise because of a\n",
    "        use after free. As the name implies, a use-after-free error\n",
    "        occurs when a program uses memory after it has been freed. There\n",
    "        are two common scenarios that give rise to a use after free:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1.  Scenario 1:\n",
    "            1.  One part of a program (part A) frees an area of memory\n",
    "                that held a variable of type T that it no longer needs\n",
    "            2.  Another part of the program (part B) has a pointer to\n",
    "                that very memory\n",
    "            3.  A third part of the program (part C) overwrites that\n",
    "                \"freed\" area of memory with a variable of type S\n",
    "            4.  Part B accesses the memory assuming that it still holds\n",
    "                a variable of Type T\n",
    "        2.  Scenario 2:\n",
    "            1.  One part of a program (part A) frees an area of memory\n",
    "                that held a variable of type T that it no longer needs\n",
    "            2.  Part A never nullifies the pointer it used to point to\n",
    "                that area of memory though the pointer is now invalid\n",
    "                because the program has released the space\n",
    "            3.  A second part of the program (part C) overwrites that\n",
    "                \"freed\" area of memory with a variable of type S\n",
    "            4.  Part A incorrectly accesses the memory using the invalid\n",
    "                pointer assuming that it still holds a variable of Type\n",
    "                T\n",
    "\n",
    "        Scenario 2 is depicted visually in the following scenario and\n",
    "        intimates why use-after-free errors are considered security\n",
    "        vulnerabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "        ![](attachment:images/pl/6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "        In the example shown visually above, the program's use of the\n",
    "        invalid pointer means that the user of the invalid pointer can\n",
    "        now access an object that is at a higher privilege level\n",
    "        (Restricted vs Regular) than the programmer intended. When the\n",
    "        programmer calls a function through the invalid pointer they\n",
    "        expect that a method on the Regular object will be called.\n",
    "        Unfortunately, a method on the Restricted object will be called\n",
    "        instead. Trouble!\n",
    "\n",
    "        The latter problem occurs when a pointer targets memory beyond\n",
    "        the program's control. This most often occurs when the program\n",
    "        sets a variable's address to 0 (NULL, null, nil) to indicate\n",
    "        that it is invalid but later uses that pointer without checking\n",
    "        its validity. For compiled languages this often results in the\n",
    "        dreaded segmentation fault and for interpreted languages it\n",
    "        often results in other anomalous behavior (like Java's Null\n",
    "        Pointer Exception (NPE)). Neither are good!\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  Possible Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "        Wouldn't it be nice if we had a way to make sure that the\n",
    "        pointer being dereferenced is valid so we fall victim to some of\n",
    "        the aforementioned problems? What would be the requirements of\n",
    "        such a solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "        1.  Pointers to areas of memory that have been deallocated\n",
    "            cannot be dereferenced.\n",
    "        2.  The type of the object at the target of a pointer always\n",
    "            matches the programmer's expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Your author describes two potential ways of doing this. First,\n",
    "        are tombstones. Tombstones are essentially an intermediary\n",
    "        between a pointer and its target. When the programming language\n",
    "        implements pointers and uses tombstones for protection, a new\n",
    "        tombstone is allocated for each pointer the programmer\n",
    "        generates. The programmer's pointer targets the tombstone and\n",
    "        the tombstone targets the pointer's actual target. The tombstone\n",
    "        also contains an extra bit of information: whether it is valid.\n",
    "        When the programmer first instantiates a pointer to some target\n",
    "        a the compiler/interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "        1.  generates a tombstone whose target is a\n",
    "        2.  sets the valid bit of the tombstone to valid\n",
    "        3.  points the programmer's pointer to the tombstone.\n",
    "\n",
    "        When the programmer dereferences their pointer, the\n",
    "        compiler/runtime will check to make sure that the target\n",
    "        tombstone's valid flag is set to valid before doing the actual\n",
    "        dereference of the ultimate target. When the programmer\n",
    "        \"destroys\" the pointer (by releasing the memory at its target or\n",
    "        by some other means), the compiler/runtime will set the target\n",
    "        tombstone's valid flag to invalid. As a result, if the\n",
    "        programmer later attempts to dereference the pointer after it\n",
    "        was destroyed, the compiler/runtime will see that the\n",
    "        tombstone's valid flag is invalid and generate an appropriate\n",
    "        error.\n",
    "\n",
    "        This process is depicted visually in the following diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Tombstones.png\n",
    "\n",
    "        This seems like a great solution! Unfortunately, there are\n",
    "        downsides. In order for the tombstone to provide protection for\n",
    "        the entirety of the program's execution, once a tombstone has\n",
    "        been allocated it cannot be reclaimed. It must remain in place\n",
    "        forever because it is always possible that the programmer can\n",
    "        incorrectly reuse an invalid pointer. As soon as the tombstone\n",
    "        is deallocated, the protection that it provides is gone. The\n",
    "        other problem is that the use of tombstones adds an additional\n",
    "        layer of indirection to dereference a pointer and every\n",
    "        indirection causes memory accesses. Though memory access times\n",
    "        are small, they are not zero – the cost of these additional\n",
    "        memory accesses add up.\n",
    "\n",
    "        What about a solution that does not require an additional level\n",
    "        of indirection? There is a so-called lock-and-key technique.\n",
    "        This protection method requires that the pointer hold an\n",
    "        additional piece of information beyond the address of the\n",
    "        target: the key. The memory at the target of the pointer is also\n",
    "        required to hold a key. When the system allocates memory it sets\n",
    "        the keys of the pointer and the target to be the same value.\n",
    "        When the programmer dereferences a pointer, the two keys are\n",
    "        compared and the operation is only allowed to continue if the\n",
    "        keys are the same. The process is depicted visually below.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ![](attachment:images/pl/7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "        With this technique, there is no additional memory access –\n",
    "        that's good! However, there are still downsides. First, there is\n",
    "        a speed cost. For every dereference there must be a check of the\n",
    "        equality of the keys. Depending on the length of the key that\n",
    "        can take a significant amount of time. Second, there is a space\n",
    "        cost. Every pointer and block of allocated memory now must have\n",
    "        enough space to store the key. For systems where memory\n",
    "        allocations are done in big chunks, the relative size overhead\n",
    "        of storing, say, and 8byte key is not significant. However, if\n",
    "        the system allocates many small areas of memory, the relative\n",
    "        size overhead is tremendous. Moreover, the more heavily the\n",
    "        system relies on pointers the more space will be used to store\n",
    "        keys rather than meaningful data.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Well, let's just make the keys smaller? Great idea. There's only\n",
    "        one problem: The smaller the keys the fewer unique key values.\n",
    "        Fewer unique key values mean that it is more likely an invalid\n",
    "        pointer randomly points to a chunk of memory with a matching\n",
    "        key. In this scenario, the protection afforded by the scheme is\n",
    "        vitiated. (I just wanted to type that word – I'm not even sure I\n",
    "        am using it correctly!)\n",

    "### Pointers for Dynamic Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "We finished up our discussion of pointers in today's class. In the\n",
    "previous class, we talked about how pointers have two important roles in\n",
    "programming languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  indirection – referring to other objects\n",
    "2.  dynamic memory management – \"handles\" for areas of memory that are\n",
    "    dynamically allocated and deallocated by the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Monday we focused on the role of pointers in indirection and how to\n",
    "solve some of the problems that can arise from using pointers in that\n",
    "capacity. In today's class, we focused on the role of pointers in\n",
    "dynamic memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "As tools for dynamic memory management, the programmer can use pointers\n",
    "to target blocks (N.B.: I am using blocks as a generic term for memory\n",
    "and am not using it in the sense of a block \\[a.k.a. page\\] as defined\n",
    "in the context of operating systems) of dynamic memory that are\n",
    "allocated and deallocated by the operating system for use by an\n",
    "application. The programmer can use these pointers to manipulate what is\n",
    "stored in those blocks and, ultimately, release them back to the\n",
    "operating system when they are no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory in the system is a finite resource. If a program repeatedly asks\n",
    "for memory from the system without releasing previous allocations back\n",
    "to the system, there will come a time when the memory is exhausted. In\n",
    "order to be able to release existing allocations back to the operating\n",
    "system for reuse by other applications, the programmer must not lose\n",
    "track of those existing allocations. When there is a memory allocation\n",
    "from the operating system to the application that can no longer be\n",
    "reached by a pointer in the application, that memory allocation is\n",
    "leaked. Because the application no longer has a pointer to it, there is\n",
    "no way for the application to release it back to the system. Leaked\n",
    "memory belongs to the leaking application until it terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some programs this is fine. Some applications run for a short,\n",
    "defined period of time. However, there are other programs (especially\n",
    "servers) that are written specifically to operate for extended periods\n",
    "of time. If such applications leak memory, they run the risk of\n",
    "exhausting the system's memory resources and failing (Links to an\n",
    "external site.).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Preventing Memory Leaks\n",
    "\n",
    "    System behavior will be constrained when those systems are written\n",
    "    in languages that do not support using pointers for dynamic memory\n",
    "    management. However, what we learned (above) is that it is not\n",
    "    always easy to use pointers for dynamic memory management correctly.\n",
    "    What are some of the tools that programming languages provide to\n",
    "    help the programmer manage pointers in their role as managers of\n",
    "    dynamic memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Reference Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "        In a reference-counted memory management system, each allocated\n",
    "        block of memory given to the application by the system contains\n",
    "        a reference count. That reference count, well, counts the number\n",
    "        of references to the object. In other words, for every pointer\n",
    "        to an operating-system allocated block of memory, the reference\n",
    "        count on that block increases. Every time that a pointer's\n",
    "        target is changed, the programming language updates the\n",
    "        reference counts of the old target (decrement) and the new\n",
    "        target (increment), if there is a new target (the pointer could\n",
    "        be changed to null, in which case there is no new target). When\n",
    "        a block's reference count reaches zero, the language knows that\n",
    "        the block is no longer needed, and automatically returns it to\n",
    "        the system! Pretty cool.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ![](attachment:images/pl/9.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "        The scenario depicted visually shows the reference counting\n",
    "        process. At time (a), the programmer allocates a block of memory\n",
    "        dynamically from the operating system and puts an application\n",
    "        object in that block. Assume that the application object is a\n",
    "        node in a linked list. The first node is the head of the list.\n",
    "        Because the programmer has a pointer that targets that\n",
    "        allocation, the block's reference count at time (a) is 1. At\n",
    "        time (b), the programmer allocates a second block of memory\n",
    "        dynamically from the system and puts a second application object\n",
    "        in that block – another node in the linked list (the tail of the\n",
    "        list). Because the head of the list is referencing the tail of\n",
    "        the list, the reference count of the tail is 1. At time (c) the\n",
    "        programmer deletes their pointer (or reassigns it to a different\n",
    "        target) to the head of the linked list. The programming language\n",
    "        decrements the reference count of the block of memory holding\n",
    "        the head node and deallocates it because the reference count has\n",
    "        dropped to 0. Transitively, the pointer from the head\n",
    "        application object to the tail application object is deleted and\n",
    "        the programming language decrements the reference count of its\n",
    "        target, the block of memory holding the tail application object\n",
    "        (time (d)). The reference count of the block of memory holding\n",
    "        the tail application object is now 0 and so the programming\n",
    "        language automatically deallocates the associated storage (time\n",
    "        (e)). Voila – an automatic way to handle dynamic memory\n",
    "        management.\n",
    "\n",
    "        There's only one problem. What if the programmer wants to\n",
    "        implement a circularly linked list?\n",
    "\n",
    "        ![](attachment:images/pl/10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "        Because the tail node points to the head node, and the head node\n",
    "        points to the tail node, even after the programmer's pointer to\n",
    "        the head node is deleted or retargeted, the reference counts of\n",
    "        the two nodes will never drop to 0. In other words, even with\n",
    "        reference-counted automatic memory management, there could still\n",
    "        be a memory leak! Although there are algorithms to break these\n",
    "        cycles, it's important to remember that reference counting is\n",
    "        not a panacea. Python is a language that manages memory using\n",
    "        reference counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Garbage Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "    Garbage collection (GC) is another method of automatically managing\n",
    "    dynamically allocated memory. In a GC'd system, when a programmer\n",
    "    allocates memory to store an object and no space is available, the\n",
    "    programming language will stop the execution of the program (a\n",
    "    so-called GC pause) to calculate which previously allocated memory\n",
    "    blocks are no longer in use and can be returned to the system.\n",
    "    Having freed up space as a result of cleaning up unused garbage, the\n",
    "    allocation requested by the programmer can be satisfied and the\n",
    "    execution of the program can continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The most efficient way to engineer a GC'd system is if the\n",
    "    programming language allocates memory to the programmer in\n",
    "    fixed-size cells. In this scenario, every allocation request from\n",
    "    the programmer is satisfied by a block of memory from one of several\n",
    "    banks of fixed-size blocks that are stacked back-to-back. For\n",
    "    example, a programming language may manage three different banks –\n",
    "    one that holds reserves of X-sized blocks, one that holds reserves\n",
    "    of Y-sized blocks and one that holds reserves of Z-sized blocks.\n",
    "    When the programmer asks for memory to hold an object that is of\n",
    "    size a, the programming language will deliver a block that is just\n",
    "    big enough to that object. Because the size of the requested\n",
    "    allocation may not be exactly the same size as one of the available\n",
    "    fixed-size blocks, space may be wasted.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The fixed sizing of blocks in a GC'd system makes it easy/fast to\n",
    "    walk through every block of memory. We will see shortly that the GC\n",
    "    algorithm requires such an operation every time that it stops the\n",
    "    program to do a cleanup. Without a consistent size, traversing the\n",
    "    memory blocks would require that each block hold a tag indicating\n",
    "    its size – a waste of space and the cause of an additional memory\n",
    "    read – so that the algorithm could dynamically calculate the\n",
    "    starting address of the next block.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When the programmer requests an allocation that cannot be satisfied,\n",
    "    the programming language stops the execution of the program and does\n",
    "    a garbage collection. The classic GC algorithm is called mark and\n",
    "    sweep and has three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Every block of memory is marked as free using a free bit attached to\n",
    "    the block. Of course, this is only true of some of the blocks, but\n",
    "    the GC is optimistic! All pointers active at the time the program is\n",
    "    paused are traced to their targets. The free bits of those blocks\n",
    "    are reset. The blocks that are marked free and released.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The process is shown visually below:\n",

    "We spent Friday beginning our module on Functional Programming (FP)! As\n",
    "we said at the beginning of the semester when we were learning about\n",
    "programming paradigms, FP is very different than imperative programming.\n",
    "In imperative programming, developers tell the computer how to do the\n",
    "operation. While functional programming is not logic programming (where\n",
    "developers just tell the computer what to compute and leave the how\n",
    "entirely to the language implementation), the writer of a program in a\n",

    "\n",
    "### Four Characteristics of Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four characteristics that epitomize FP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  There is no state\n",
    "2.  Functions are central\n",
    "    1.  Functions can be parameters to other functions\n",
    "    2.  Functions can be return values from other others\n",
    "    3.  Program execution is function evaluation\n",
    "3.  Control flow is performed by recursion and conditional expressions\n",
    "4.  Lists are a fundamental data type\n",
    "\n",
    "In a functional programming language, there are no variables, per se.\n",
    "And because there are no variables, there is no state. That does not\n",
    "mean there are no names. Names are still important. It simply means that\n",
    "names refer to expressions themselves and not their values. The\n",
    "distinction will become more obvious as we continue to learn more about\n",
    "writing programs in functional languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there is no state, a functional programming language is not\n",
    "history sensitive. A language that is history sensitive means that\n",
    "results of operations in that language can be affected by operations\n",
    "that have come before it. For example, in an imperative programming\n",
    "language, a function may be history sensitive if it relies on the value\n",
    "of a global variable to calculate its return value. Why does that count\n",
    "as history sensitive? Because the value in the global variable could be\n",
    "affected by prior operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A language that is not history sensitive has referential transparency.\n",
    "We learned the definition of referential transparency before, but now it\n",
    "might make a little more sense. In a language that has referential\n",
    "transparency, a the same function called with the same arguments\n",
    "generates the same result no matter what operations have preceded it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a functional programming language there are no loops (unless they are\n",
    "added as syntactic sugar) – recursion is the way to accomplish\n",
    "repetition. Selective execution (as opposed to sequential execution) is\n",
    "accomplished using the conditional expression. A conditional expression\n",
    "is, well, an expression that evaluates to one of two values depending on\n",
    "the value of a condition. We have seen conditional expressions in\n",
    "STIMPL. That a conditional statement can have a value (thus making it a\n",
    "conditional expression) is relatively surprising for people who only\n",
    "have experience in imperative programming languages. Nevertheless, the\n",
    "conditional expressions is a very, very sharp sword in the sheath of the\n",
    "functional programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A functional program is a series of functions and the execution of a\n",
    "functional program is simply an evaluation of those functions. That\n",
    "sounds abstract at this point, but will become more clear when we see\n",
    "some real functional programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are a fundamental data type in functional programming languages.\n",
    "Powerful syntactic tools for manipulating lists are built in to most\n",
    "functional PLs. Understanding how to wield these tools effectively is\n",
    "vital for writing code in functional PLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Historical Setting of the Development of Functional PLs\n",
    "\n",
    "The first functional programming language was developed in the mid-1950s\n",
    "by [John\n",
    "McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist))\n",
    ". At the time, computing was most associated with mathematical\n",
    "calculations. McCarthy was instead focused on artificial intelligence\n",
    "which involved symbolic computing. Computer scientists thought that it\n",
    "was possible to represent cognitive processes as lists of symbols. A\n",
    "language that made it possible to process those lists would allow\n",
    "developers to build systems that work like our brains.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](attachment:images/pl/_56264828_johnmccarthy2-1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "McCarthy started with the goal of writing a system of meta notation that\n",
    "programmers could attach to Fortran. These meta notations would be\n",
    "reduced to actual Fortran programs. As they did their work, they found\n",
    "their way to a program representation built entirely of lists (and lists\n",
    "of lists, and lists of lists of lists, etc). Their thinking resulted in\n",
    "the development of Lisp, a list processing language. In Lisp, data are\n",
    "lists and programs are lists. They showed that list processing, the\n",
    "basis of the semantics of Lisp, is capable of universal computing. In\n",
    "other words, Lisp, and other list processing languages, is/are Turing\n",
    "complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inability to execute a Lisp program efficiently on a physical\n",
    "computer based on the von Neumann model has given Lisp (and other\n",
    "functional programming languages) a reputation as slow and wasteful.\n",
    "(N.B.: This is not true today!) Until the late 1980s hardware vendors\n",
    "thought that it would be worthwhile to build physical machines with\n",
    "non-von Neumann architectures that made executing Lisp programs faster.\n",
    "Here is an image of a so-called Lisp Machine.\n",

    "### LISP\n",

    "We will not study Lisp in this course. However, there are a few aspects\n",
    "of Lisp that you should know because they pervade the general field of\n",
    "computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you should know CAR, CDR and CONS – pronounced car, could-er, and\n",
    "cahns, respectively. CAR is a function that takes a list as a parameter\n",
    "and returns the first element of the list. CDR is a function that takes\n",
    "a list as a parameter and returns the tail, everything but the head, of\n",
    "the list. CONS takes two parameters – a single element and a list – and\n",
    "returns a new list with the first argument appended to the front of the\n",
    "second argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance,\n",
    "\n",
    "``` elisp\n",
    "(car (1 2 3))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` elisp\n",
    "(cdr (1 2 3))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is `(2 3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, you should know that, in Lisp, all data are lists *and* programs\n",

    "\n",
    "``` elisp\n",
    "(a b c)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "argument! But didn't I say that functions in the Lambda Calculus don't\n",
    "have names? Yes, I did. Within the language there is no way to name a\n",

    "    pass\n",

    "```\n",

    "another function, one that takes a single parameter! So, we've knocked\n",
    "off two of the three parameters, now we need one more. So, let's write\n",
    "something like this:\n",

    "``` python\n",

    "    return sum3\n",
    "  return sum2\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if we call sum1 with a single parameter and call the\n",
    "result of that with a single parameter, the result is another function,\n",
    "one that also takes a single parameter! What do we want that innermost\n",
    "function to do? That's right: the summation! So, here's our final code:\n",

    "### The Tail That Wags the Dog\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no loops in functional programming languages. We've learned\n",
    "that, instead, functional programming languages are characterised by the\n",
    "fact that they use recursion for control flow. As we discussed earlier\n",
    "in the class (much earlier, in fact), when running code on a von Neumann\n",
    "machine, iterative algorithms typically perform faster than recursive\n",
    "algorithms because of the way that the former leverages the properties\n",
    "of the hardware (e.g., [spatial and temporal locality of\n",
    "code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference) ). In\n",
    "addition, recursive algorithms typically use much more memory than\n",
    "iterative algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? To answer that question, we will need to recall what we learned\n",
    "about stack frames. For every function invocation, an activation record\n",
    "(aka stack frame) is allocated on the run-time stack (aka call stack).\n",
    "The function's parameters, local variables, and return value are all\n",
    "stored in its activation record. The activation record for a function\n",
    "invocation remains on the stack until it has completed execution. In\n",
    "other words, if a function f invokes a function g, then function f's\n",
    "activation record remains on the stack until (at least) g has completed\n",
    "execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider some algorithm A. Let's assume that an iterative implementation\n",
    "of A requires n executions of a loop and l local integer variables. If\n",
    "that implementation is contained in a function, an invocation of that\n",
    "function would consume approximately l\\*sizeof(integer variable) +\n",
    "activation record overhead space on the runtime stack. Let's further\n",
    "assume that a function implementing the recursive version of A also uses\n",
    "l local integer variables and also requires n executions of itself. Each\n",
    "invocation of the implementing function, then, needs l\\*sizeof(integer\n",
    "variable) + activation record overhead space on the runtime stack.\n",
    "Multiply that by n, the number of recursive calls, and you can see that,\n",
    "at it's peak, executing the recursive version of algorithm A requires n\n",

    "only has a finite amount of stack space. Given a long enough list, myLen\n",
    "could cause so many activation records to be placed on the stack that\n",
    "the amount of stack space is exhausted and the program crashes. In other\n",

    "\n",
    "### Tail Recursion - Hope\n",
    "\n",
    "The activation records of functions that recursively call themselves\n",

    "What if there was some way to rewrite a recursive function in a way that\n",
    "it did not need to wait on a future recursive invocation to completely\n",
    "calculate its result? If that could happen, then the stack frame of the\n",
    "current invocation of the function could be replaced by the stack frame\n",
    "of the recursive invocation. Why? Because the information contained in\n",
    "the current invocation of the function has no bearing on its overall\n",
    "result – the only information needed to completely calculate the result\n",
    "of the function is the result of the future recursive invocation! The\n",
    "implementation of a recursive function that matches this specification\n",
    "is known as a tail-recursive function. The book says \"A function is tail\n",
    "recursive if its recursive call is the last operation in the function.\"\n",

    "solution! Ron Popeil, that's a deal!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rewriting\n",
    "\n",
    "The rub is that we need to figure out a way to rewrite those non-tail\n",
    "recursive functions into tail-recursive versions. I am not aware of any\n",
    "general purpose algorithms for such a conversion. However, there is one\n",
    "technique that is widely applicable: accumulators. It is sometimes\n",
    "possible to add a parameter to a non-tail recursive function and use\n",
    "that parameter to define a tail-recursive version. Seeing an accumulator\n",
    "in action is the easiest way to define the technique. Let's rewrite\n",
    "myLen in a tail-recursive manner using an accumulator:\n",

    "myLenImpl acc (x:xs) = myLenImpl (1 + acc) xs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First, notice how we are turning myLen into a function that simply\n",
    "invokes a worker function whose job is to do the actual calculation! The\n",
    "first parameter to myLenImpl is used to hold a running tally of the\n",
    "length of the list so far. The first invocation of myLenImpl from the\n",
    "implementation of myLen, then, passes 0 as the argument to the\n",

    "Next, instead of defining trSimpleSumImpl and trSimpleProductImpl with\n",

    "### Think About the Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "We've stumbled on a pretty useful pattern! Let's look at its components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A \"driver\" function (called trSimpleOpImpl) that takes three\n",
    "    parameters: an initial value (of a particular type, T), an operation\n",
    "    function (see below) and a list of inputs, each of which is of\n",
    "    type T.\n",
    "2.  An operation function that takes two parameters – a running total,\n",
    "    of some type R; an element to \"accumulate\" on to the running total\n",
    "    of type T – and returns a new running total of type R.\n",
    "3.  A list of inputs, each of which is of type T.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the types of those functions in Haskell:\n",
    "\n",
    "operation function: R -\\> T -\\> R\n",
    "\n",
    "list of inputs: \\[T\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "driver function: T -\\> (R -\\> T -\\> R) -\\> R\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's play around and see what we can write using this pattern. How\n",
    "about a concatenation of a list of strings in to a single string?\n",
    "\n",
    "``` haskell\n",
    "concatenateOperation concatenatedString newString = concatenatedString ++ newString\n",
    "concatenateStrings list = trSimpleOpImpl \"\" concatenateOperation list\n",
    "```\n",

    "\"Hello,World\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So far our Ts and Rs have been the same – integers and strings. But, the\n",
    "signatures indicate that they could be different types! Let's take\n",
    "advantage of that! Let's use trSimplOpImpl to write a function that\n",
    "returns True if every element in the list is equal to the number 1 and\n",
    "False otherwise. Let's call the operation function continuesToBeAllOnes\n",

    "implement a function named isListAllOnes using continuesToBeAllOnes and\n",

    "``` haskell\n",
    "isListAllOnes list = trSimpleOpImpl True continuesToBeAllOnes list\n",

    "Prolog glossary:\n",
    "\n",
    "backtracking: Search process used by Prolog. If a predicate offers\n",
    "multiple clauses to solve a goal, they are tried one-by-one until one\n",
    "succeeds. If a subsequent part of the proof is not satisfied with the\n",
    "resulting variable binding, it may ask for an alternative solution,\n",
    "causing Prolog to reject the previously chosen clause and try the next\n",
    "one.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of undefined words in that definition! Let's dig a little\n",
    "deeper.\n",
    "\n",
    "A predicate is like a boolean function. A predicate takes one or more\n",
    "arguments and yields true/false. As we said at the outset of our\n",
    "discussion about declarative programming languages, the reason that a\n",
    "predicate may yield true or false depends on the semantics imposed upon\n",
    "it from the outside. A predicate is a term borrowed from first-order\n",
    "logic, a topic that we will return to in later lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember our takes example from previous lectures? takes is a predicate!\n",
    "takes has two arguments and returns a boolean.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Prolog, rules and facts are written to define predicates. A rule\n",
    "defines the conditions under which a predicate is true using a body – a\n",
    "list of other predicates, logical conjunctives, implications, etc. See\n",
    "The Daily PL - 11/3/2021 for additional information about rules. A fact\n",

    "In the example above, related is a predicate defined by facts and rules.\n",
    "The facts and rules above are the clauses of the predicate.\n",

    "behavior of a Prolog program. A red cut does alter the behavior of a\n",
    "Prolog program. The implication was that red cuts are bad and green cuts\n",
    "are good. But, is this always the case?\n",
    "\n",
    "To frame our discussion, let's look at a Prolog program that performs a\n",
    "Bubble Sort on a list of numbers. The predicate, bsort/2, is defined\n",
    "like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` prolog\n",
    "bsort(Unsorted, Sorted):-\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first rule handles the recursive case (when there is at least one\n",

    "the list is sorted). According to this definition, how does Prolog\n",
    "handle the query\n",
    "\n",
    "``` prolog\n",
    "bsort([2,1,3,5], M).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Prolog (as we are well aware) searches its rule top to bottom. The first\n",
    "rule that it sees is the recursive case and Prolog immediately opts for\n",
    "it. Opting for this case is not without consequences – a choice point is\n",
    "created. Why? Because Prolog made the choice to attempt to satisfy the\n",
    "query according to the first rule and not the (just as applicable)\n",
    "second rule! Let's call this choice point A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, Prolog attempts to unify the subquery append(Left, \\[A, B \\|\n",
    "Right\\], Unsorted). The first (of many) unifications that append/3\n",
    "generates is Left = \\[\\], A = 2, B = 1, Right = \\[3, 5\\]. By continuing\n",
    "with this particular unification, Prolog creates another choice point.\n",
    "For what reason? Well, Prolog knows that append/3 could generate other\n",
    "potential unifications and it will need to check those to see if they,\n",
    "too, satisfy the original query! Let's call this choice point B. Next,\n",
    "Prolog checks whether A is less than B – it is. Prolog continues in a\n",

    "append/3 that meet the criteria for A\\<B in Unsorted. In other words,\n",

    "![](attachment:images/pl/bsort no cut.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the querier is using bsort/2 declaratively, this scenario is a\n",

    "``` prolog\n",
    "[2,1,3,5]\n",

    "\n",

    "understand why the results are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what are we to do? cut/0 (Links to an external site.) to the rescue!\n",
    "Logically speaking, once our bsort/3 rule finds a single element out of\n",

    "### The Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have said in the past, there is a theoretical underpinning for\n",
    "each of the programming paradigms that we have studied this semester.\n",
    "Logic programming is no different. The theory behind logic programming\n",
    "is first-order predicate logic. Predicate logic is an extension of\n",
    "propositional logic. Propositional logic is based on the evaluation of\n",
    "propositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A proposition is simply any statement that can be true or false. For\n",
    "example,\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Will is a programmer.\n",
    "-   Alicia is a programmer.\n",
    "-   Sam is a programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those statements can be true or false. In propositional logic we can\n",
    "build more complicated propositions from existing propositions using\n",
    "logical connectives like and, or, not, and implication (if … then). Each\n",
    "of these has an associated truth table to determine the truth of two\n",
    "combined propositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look closely at the example propositions above and you will notice an\n",
    "underlying theme: they all do with someone (let's call them x) being a\n",
    "programmer. In propositional logic, our ability to reason using that\n",
    "underlying theme is impossible. We can only work with the truth of the\n",
    "statement as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we add to propositional logic variables, constants, and quantifiers\n",
    "then we get predicate logic and we are able to reason more subtly.\n",
    "Although you might argue that propositional logic has variables,\n",
    "everyone can agree that they are limited – they can only have two\n",
    "values, true and false. In first-order predicate logic, variables can\n",
    "have domains other than just {T, F}. That's already a huge step!\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantifiers \"define\" variables and \"constrain\" their possible values.\n",
    "There are two quantifiers in first-order predicate logic – the universal\n",
    "and the existential. The universal is the \"for all\" (aka \"every\")\n",
    "quantifier. We can use the universal quantifier to write statements (in\n",
    "logic) like \"Every person is a Bearcats fan.\" Symbolically, we write the\n",
    "universal quantifier with the $\\forall$. We can write our obvious\n",
    "statement from above in logic like\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\forall x(person(x) \\Longrightarrow fan(x, bearcats))$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are talking! As for the existential quantifier, it allows us to\n",
    "write statements (in logic) like \"There is some person on earth that\n",
    "speaks Russian.\" Symbolically, we write the existential quantifier with\n",
    "the $\\exists$. We can write the statement about our Russian-speaking\n",
    "person as\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\exists x(person(x) \\land speaks(x, russion))$\n",
    "\n",
    "How are quantifiers embedded in Prolog? Variables in Prolog queries are\n",
    "existentially qualified – \"Does there exist …?\"​ Variables in Prolog\n",
    "rules are universally quantified – \"For all ….\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In first-order predicate logic, there are such things as Boolean-valued\n",
    "functions. This is familiar territory for us programmers. A\n",
    "Boolean-valued function is a function that has 0 or more parameters and\n",
    "returns true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these definitions, we can now define predicates: A predicate is a\n",
    "proposition in which some Boolean variables are replaced by\n",
    "Boolean-valued functions and quantified expressions. Let's look at an\n",
    "example.\n",
    "\n",
    "$p \\Longrightarrow q$\n",
    "\n",
    "is a proposition where p and q are boolean variables. Replace p with the\n",
    "Boolean-valued function $is\\_teacher(x)$ and q with the quantified\n",
    "expression $\\exists y(student(x) \\land teaches(x, russion))$ and we have\n",
    "the predicate\n",
    "\n",
    "$is\\_teacher(x) \\Longrightarrow \\exists y(student(x) \\land teaches(x,y))$\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one remaining question: Why is it called first-order\n",
    "predicate logic and not, say, higher-order predicate logic?\n",
    "\"First-order\" here indicates that the predicates in this logic cannot\n",
    "manipulate or reason about predicates themselves. Does this sound\n",
    "familiar? Imperative languages can define functions but they cannot\n",
    "reason about functions themselves while functional languages can!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11/17/2021\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this course we have covered lots of material. We've learned\n",
    "lots of definitions, explored lots of concepts and programmed in\n",
    "languages that we've never seen before. In all that time, though, we\n",
    "never really got to the bottom of one thing: What exactly is a language?\n",
    "In the final module of this course, we are going to cover exactly that!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Back to Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think way back to [August\n",
    "23](https://uc.instructure.com/courses/1476336/pages/the-daily-pl-8-slash-23-slash-2021)\n",
    "and recall two very important definitions: syntax and semantics. On that\n",
    "day we defined semantics as the effect of each statement's execution on\n",
    "the program's operation. We defined syntax as the rules for constructing\n",
    "structurally valid (note: valid, not correct) computer programs in a\n",
    "particular language. There's that word again – language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting to define language, let me offer you two alternate\n",
    "definitions for syntax and semantics that draw out the distinction\n",
    "between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The syntax of a programming language specifies the form of its\n",
    "    expressions, statements and program units.\n",
    "-   The semantics of a programming language specifies the meaning of its\n",
    "    expressions, statements and program units.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to see those two definitions side-by-side and realize\n",
    "that they are basically identical with the exception of a single word!\n",
    "One final note about the connection between syntax and semantics before\n",
    "moving forward: Remember how a well-designed programming language has a\n",
    "syntax that is evocative of meaning. In other words, a [well-designed\n",
    "language](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1345843/what-does-the-question-mark-at-the-end-of-a-method-name-mean-in-ruby)\n",
    "might allow variables to contain a symbol like ? which would allow the\n",
    "programmer to indicate that it holds a Boolean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can specify a syntax for a programming language, we need to\n",
    "specify the language itself. In order to do that, we need to start by\n",
    "defining the language's alphabet – finite set of characters that can be\n",
    "used to write sentences in that language. We usually denote the alphabet\n",
    "of a language with the $\\sum$. It is sometimes helpful to denote the set\n",
    "of all the possible sentences that can be written using the characters\n",
    "in the alphabet. We usually denote that with $\\sum$. For example, say\n",
    "that $sum = \\{a, b\\}$, then\n",
    "$\\sum = \\{a, b, aa, ab, ba, aaa, aab, aba, abb, ...\\}$. Notice that even\n",
    "though $|\\sum|$ is finite (that is, the number of elements in is\n",
    "finite), $|\\sum| = \\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alphabet of the C++ programming language is large, but it's not\n",
    "infinite. However, the set of sentences that can be written using that\n",
    "alphabet is. But, as we all learn early in our programming career, just\n",
    "because you can write out a program using the valid symbols in the C++\n",
    "alphabet does not mean the program is syntactically valid. The very job\n",
    "of the compiler is to distinguish between valid and invalid programs,\n",
    "right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call the language that we are defining $L$ and say that it's\n",
    "alphabet is $\\sum$. $L$ can be thought of as the set of all valid\n",
    "sentences in the language. Therefore, every sentence that is in $L$ is\n",
    "in $\\sum$ – $L \\subseteq \\sum$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](attachment:images/pl/L is a subset of E .png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Look closely at the relationship between $\\sum$ and $L$. While $L$ never\n",
    "includes a sentence that is not included in $\\sum$, they can be\n",
    "identical! Think of some languages where any combination of characters\n",
    "from its alphabet are valid sentences! Can you come up with one?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Really Bad Programmer\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how can we determine whether a sentence made up of characters from\n",
    "the alphabet is in the language or not? We have to be able to answer\n",
    "this question – one of the fundamental jobs of the compiler, after all,\n",
    "is to do exactly that. Why not just write down every single valid\n",
    "sentence in a giant chart and compare the program with that list? If the\n",
    "program is in the list, then it's a valid program! That's easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not so fast. Aren't there an infinite number of valid C++ programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "    int main() {\n",

    "Well, dang. There goes that idea.\n",

    "I guess we need a concise way to specify how to describe sentences that\n",
    "are in the language and those that are not. Before we start to think\n",
    "about ways to do that, let's think back to Prolog. One of the really\n",
    "neat things about Prolog was the ability to specify something that had,\n",
    "at the same time, an ability to recognize and generate valid solutions\n",
    "to a set of constraints. Even in our simplest Prolog example, we could\n",
    "write down a set of facts and the language could determine whether a\n",

    "a list of the people who were taking a particular class!\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be great to have a tool that does the same thing for languages\n",
    "– a common description that allows us to create something that\n",
    "recognizes and generates valid sentences in the language. We will do\n",
    "exactly that!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Language Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "The famous linguist Noam Chomsky was the first to recognize how there is\n",
    "a hierarchy of languages. The hierarchy is founded upon the concept of\n",

    "\n",
    "### Context-Free Grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool that we can use to concisely specify a Context-Free language is\n",
    "called a Context-Free Grammar. Precisely, a Context-Free Grammar, , is a\n",
    "set of productions , a set of terminal symbols, , a set of non-terminal\n",
    "symbols, , one of which is named\n",

    "To reiterate, the goal of a parser is to convert the source code for a\n",
    "program written in a particular programming language defined according\n",
    "to a specific grammar into a parse tree. Parsing occurs in two parts:\n",
    "lexical analysis and syntax analysis. The lexical analyzer (what we\n",
    "studied in the previous lecture) converts the program's source code (in\n",
    "the form of bytes on disk) into a sequence of tokens. The syntax\n",

    "to a parse tree. The lexical analyzer and the syntax analyzer go\n",
    "hand-in-hand: As the syntax analyzer goes about its business of creating\n",
    "a parse tree, it will periodically turn to the lexical analyzer and say,\n",
    "\"Give me the next token!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw algorithms for building a lexical analyzer directly from the\n",

    "syntax analyzer. In today's lecture we are going to explore just one of\n",
    "the many techniques for converting a CFG into code that will build an\n",

    "versatile than others. Sebesta talks about several of these. If you take\n",

    "defined in detail. In this class we only have time to cover one\n",
    "particular technique for translating a CFG into code that constructs\n",
    "parse trees and it only works for a subset of all grammars.\n",
    "\n",
    "With those caveats in mind, let's dig in to the details!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descent Into Madness\n",
    "\n",
    "A recursive-descent parser is a type of parser that can be written\n",
    "directly from the structure of a CFG – as long as that CFG meets certain\n",
    "constraints. In a recursive descent parser built from a CFG G, there is\n",
    "a subprogram for every nonterminal in G. Most of these subprograms are\n",
    "recursive. A recursive-descent parser builds a parse tree from the top\n",
    "down, meaning that it begins with G's start symbol and attempts to build\n",
    "a parse tree that represents a valid derivation whose final sentential\n",
    "form matches the program's tokens. There are other parsers that work\n",
    "bottom up, meaning that they start by analyzing a sentential form made\n",
    "up entirely of the program's tokens and attempt to build a parse tree\n",
    "that that \"reduces\" to the grammar's start symbol. That the subprograms\n",
    "are recursive and that the parse tree is built top down, the\n",
    "recursive-descrent parser is aptly named.\n",
    "\n",
    "We mentioned before that there are limitations on the types of languages\n",
    "that a recursive-descent parser can recognize. In particular,\n",
    "recursive-descent parsers can only recognize LL grammars. Those are\n",
    "grammars whose parse trees represent a leftmost derivation and can be\n",
    "built from a single left-to-right scan of the input tokens. To be\n",
    "precise, the first L represents the left-to-right scan of the input and\n",
    "the second L indicates that the parser generates a leftmost derivation.\n",
    "There is usually another restriction – how many lookahead tokens are\n",
    "available. A lookahead token is the next token that the lexical analyzer\n",
    "will return as it scans through the input. Limiting the number of\n",
    "lookahead tokens reduces the memory requirements of the syntax analyzer\n",
    "but restricts the types of languages that those syntax analyzers can\n",
    "recognize. The number of lookahead tokens is written after LL and in\n",
    "parenthesis. LL(1) indicates 1 token of lookahead. We will see the\n",
    "practical impact of this restriction later in this edition.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these words probably seem very arbitrary, but I think that an\n",
    "example will make things clear!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Old Faithful\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's return to the grammar for mathematical expressions that we have\n",
    "been examining throughout this module:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](attachment:images/pl/UnambiguousExprGrammar.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that there are appropriately named tokens for each of the\n",
    "terminals (e.g, the ) token is CLOSE<sub>PAREN</sub>) and that any\n",
    "numbers are tokenized as ID with the lexeme set appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the definition of a recursive-descent parser, we want to\n",
    "write a (possibly recursive) subprogram for each of the nonterminals in\n",
    "the grammar. The job of each of these subprograms is to parse the the\n",
    "upcoming tokens into a parse tree that matches the nonterminal. For\n",
    "example, the (possibly recursive) subprogram for Expr, Expr, parses the\n",
    "upcoming tokens into a parse tree for an expression and returns that\n",
    "parse tree. To facilitate recursive calls among these subprograms, each\n",
    "subprogram returns the root of the parse tree that it builds. The parser\n",
    "begins by invoking the subprogram for the grammar's start symbol. The\n",
    "return value of that function call will be the root node of the parse\n",
    "tree for the entire input expression. Any recursive calls to other\n",
    "subprograms from within the subprogram for the start symbol will return\n",
    "parts of that overall parse tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am sure that you see why each of the subprograms usually contains some\n",
    "recursive function calls – the nonterminals themselves are defined\n",
    "recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would we write such a (possibly recursive) subprogram to build a\n",
    "parse tree rooted at a Factor from a sequence of tokens?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two productions for a Factor so the first thing that the\n",
    "Factor subprogram does is determine whether it is parsing, for example,\n",
    "(5+2) – a parenthesized expression – or 918 – a simple ID. In order to\n",
    "differentiate, the function simply consults the lookahead token. If that\n",
    "token is an open parenthesis then it knows that it is going to be\n",
    "evaluating the production Factor $\\rightarrow ( Expr )$. On the other\n",
    "hand, if that token is an ID, then it knows that it is going to be\n",
    "evaluating the production Factor $\\rightarrow$ id. Finally, if the\n",
    "current token is neither an open parenthesis nor an ID, then that's an\n",
    "error!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that the current token is an open parenthesis. Therefore,\n",
    "Factor knows that it should be parsing the production Factor\n",
    "$\\rightarrow ( Expr )$. Remember how we said that in a recursive-descent\n",
    "parser, each nonterminal is represented by a (possibly recursive)\n",
    "subprogram? Well, that means that we can assume there is a subprogram\n",
    "for parsing an Expr (though we haven't yet defined it!). Let's call that\n",
    "mythical subprogram Expr. As a result, the Factor subprogram can invoke\n",
    "Expr which will return a parse tree rooted at that expression. Pretty\n",
    "cool! Before continuing to parse, Factor will check Expr's return value\n",
    "– if it is an error node, then parsing stops and Factor simply returns\n",
    "that error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, after successfully parsing an expression (by invoking Expr)\n",
    "the parser expects the next token to be a close parenthesis. So, Factor\n",
    "checks that fact. If everything looks good, then Factor simply returns\n",
    "the node generated by Expr – there's no need to generate another node\n",
    "that just indicates an expression is wrapped in parenthesis. If the\n",
    "token after parsing the expression is not a close parenthesis, then\n",
    "Factor returns an error node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what happens if the lookahead token is an ID? That's simple –\n",
    "Factor will just generate a node for that ID and return it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if neither of those is true, Factor simply returns an error\n",
    "node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make this a little more concrete by writing that in pseudocode. We\n",
    "will assume the following are defined:\n",

    "1.  Node(T, X, Y, Z …): A polymorphic function that generates an\n",

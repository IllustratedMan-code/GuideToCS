*** Sets
unordered collection (group) of zero or more distinct objects
+ set theory (operations about sets)
+ S,T,U,A,B ... for sets
+ List elements in curly braces ={a, b, c}=
+ Sets are equal if and only if they contain the same elements.
**** Set Builder
+ \(\{x:P(x)\}\), \(\{x|P(x)\}\).
+ The set of all x such that P(x)
+ {x: x is an integer where x>0 and x<5}
**** Set relations
+ \(\forall\) for all
+ \(\rightarrow\) implies
+ \(\leftrightarrow\) if and only if
+ \(\exists\) exists
+ \(\nexists\) does not exist
+ \(\wedge\) and
+ \(\vee\) or
+ \(x\in S\) x in S
+ \(x \notin S\) x not in S
**** Empty set
+ \(\varnothing = \{\}\)
**** Subset and superset
+ \(S\subseteq T\) subset
+ \(S \supseteq T\) superset
+ \(S\subset T\) proper set
+ \(S \supset T\) proper superset
**** Cardinality
+ \(|S|\) Cardinality of S or the number of elements in S
**** Universal Set
+ \(U\) is the set containing all other sets (in the problem)
+ universe of discorse
**** Union
+ \(\{a,b,c\} \cup \{c,e\} = \{a,b,c,e\}\)
**** Intersection
+ \(\{a,b,c\} \cap \{c,e\} = \{c\}\)
**** Disjointedness
\(A \cap B = \varnothing\)
**** Set difference
+ \(A - B\)
+ \(\{a,b,c\} - \{c,e\} = \{a, b\}\)
+ Set of all elements in A but not B
+ Compliment with universal set
**** Compliment
+ \(\bar A = U - A\)
**** Symmetric difference
+ \(A \bigoplus B = A \cup B - A \cap B\)
**** Cartesian product
+ \(A \times B = \{(a,b) | a \in A \text{\: and \:} b \in B\}\)
+ \(|A| \times |B| = |A \times B|\)
**** Generalized Union and Intersection
Union or intersection of many sets.
** Standard Proof techniques
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION**: Set Theory
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: _index
:END:
*** Disproof by Counterexample
Shows that a conjecture is not true by pointing out an example where the conjecture does not hold.
+ No nickels
+ 1 quarter + 5 pennies
+ 3 dimes
+ Greedy method is not appropriate with limited change
*** Proof by Contradiction
Proof that the opposite cannot be true.
**** Square root of 2 is irrational
+ \(\sqrt 2 = a/b\)
+ \(a/b\) is simplified
+ a or b or both must be odd (otherwise could be simplified)
+ \(2 = a^2/b^2\)
+ \(a^2 = 2 ** b^2\)
+ \(a^2\) must be even (2 times any number is even)
+ \(a\) is even as well (odd times odd is odd)
+ \(a = 2 ** k\) where k is a / 2
+ \(2 = (2 ** k)^2/b^2 \rightarrow b^2 = 2k^2\)
+ \(b\) is also odd by this method
+ \(a\) and \(b\) cannot be odd
+ \(\sqrt 2\) cannot be rational

*** Intro to Graph Theory, Euler's Degree Formula
+ A Graph is a series of vertices (nodes) that are connected by edges
+ Degree (in this class) is equal to the number of edges that a node is connected to
+ Complete graph is a graph where every node is connected to every other node.
+ A subgraph is a graph made from a subset of nodes in another graph
+ An induced subgraph must have the same edges that the parent graph had.
*** Graph Isomorphism, Path, Coloring
+ Isomorphic graphs are identical except for node position, connections are the same
+ nodes in colored Graphs are colored to be different than all of the adjacent nodes.
+ A path is a sequence of vertices connected by edges within a graph. Vertices may be repeated. A path is the same as a trail.
+ Simple paths are paths where vertices are not repeated.
*** Planar Graphs and Euler's Polyhedron Formula
+ [[file:pdfs/SupplementalNotesPlanarGraphs.pdf][Supplemental Notes For Planar Graph (Kuratowski)]]
+ Planar graphs are graphs that can be represented isomorphically without any overlapping edges.
+ \(\sum_{g \in F}\deg(g) = 2m\) where g is a vertex in face F, and m is the number of edges
+ 5 regular polyhedra
  1. Tetrahedron
  2. Cube
  3. Dodecahedron
  4. Icosahedron
  5. Octahedron
*** Spanning Trees and Eulerian Circuits
+ Eulerian path contains all edges in a graph exactly once
+ Eulerian circuit is a circuit that contains all edges exactly once.
+ Simple path that contains every vertex in the graph is a Hamiltonian Path

** Sets
unordered collection (group) of zero or more distinct objects
+ set theory (operations about sets)
+ S,T,U,A,B ... for sets
+ List elements in curly braces ={a, b, c}=
+ Sets are equal if and only if they contain the same elements.
*** Set Builder
+ \(\{x:P(x)\}\), \(\{x|P(x)\}\).
+ The set of all x such that P(x)
+ {x: x is an integer where x>0 and x<5}
*** Set relations
+ \(\forall\) for all
+ \(\rightarrow\) implies
+ \(\leftrightarrow\) if and only if
+ \(\exists\) exists
+ \(\nexists\) does not exist
+ \(\wedge\) and
+ \(\vee\) or
+ \(x\in S\) x in S
+ \(x \notin S\) x not in S
*** Empty set
+ \(\varnothing = \{\}\)
*** Subset and superset
+ \(S\subseteq T\) subset
+ \(S \supseteq T\) superset
+ \(S\subset T\) proper set
+ \(S \supset T\) proper superset
*** Cardinality
+ \(|S|\) Cardinality of S or the number of elements in S
*** Universal Set
+ \(U\) is the set containing all other sets (in the problem)
+ universe of discorse
*** Union
+ \(\{a,b,c\} \cup \{c,e\} = \{a,b,c,e\}\)
*** Intersection
+ \(\{a,b,c\} \cap \{c,e\} = \{c\}\)
*** Disjointedness
\(A \cap B = \varnothing\)
*** Set difference
+ \(A - B\)
+ \(\{a,b,c\} - \{c,e\} = \{a, b\}\)
+ Set of all elements in A but not B
+ Compliment with universal set
*** Compliment
+ \(\bar A = U - A\)
*** Symmetric difference
+ \(A \bigoplus B = A \cup B - A \cap B\)
*** Cartesian product
+ \(A \times B = \{(a,b) | a \in A \text{\: and \:} b \in B\}\)
+ \(|A| \times |B| = |A \times B|\)
*** Generalized Union and Intersection
Union or intersection of many sets.

** Disproof by Counterexample
Shows that a conjecture is not true by pointing out an example where the conjecture does not hold.
+ No nickels
+ 1 quarter + 5 pennies
+ 3 dimes
+ Greedy method is not appropriate with limited change
** Proof by Contradiction
Proof that the opposite cannot be true.
*** Square root of 2 is irrational
+ \(\sqrt 2 = a/b\)
+ \(a/b\) is simplified
+ a or b or both must be odd (otherwise could be simplified)
+ \(2 = a^2/b^2\)
+ \(a^2 = 2 * b^2\)
+ \(a^2\) must be even (2 times any number is even)
+ \(a\) is even as well (odd times odd is odd)
+ \(a = 2 * k\) where k is a / 2
+ \(2 = (2 * k)^2/b^2 \rightarrow b^2 = 2k^2\)
+ \(b\) is also odd by this method
+ \(a\) and \(b\) cannot be odd
+ \(\sqrt 2\) cannot be rational
* Trees
:PROPERTIES:

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: _index

+ set of nodes
+ first node is root
+ every other node has a "parent" node
** Two Trees
+ Every node that is not a leaf has 2 child nodes
** Binary Trees
+ Every node has a maximum of 2 children

** Sets
unordered collection (group) of zero or more distinct objects
+ set theory (operations about sets)
+ S,T,U,A,B ... for sets
+ List elements in curly braces ={a, b, c}=
+ Sets are equal if and only if they contain the same elements.
*** Set Builder
+ \(\{x:P(x)\}\), \(\{x|P(x)\}\).
+ The set of all x such that P(x)
+ {x: x is an integer where x>0 and x<5}
*** Set relations
+ \(\forall\) for all
+ \(\rightarrow\) implies
+ \(\leftrightarrow\) if and only if
+ \(\exists\) exists
+ \(\nexists\) does not exist
+ \(\wedge\) and
+ \(\vee\) or
+ \(x\in S\) x in S
+ \(x \notin S\) x not in S
*** Empty set
+ \(\varnothing = \{\}\)
*** Subset and superset
+ \(S\subseteq T\) subset
+ \(S \supseteq T\) superset
+ \(S\subset T\) proper set
+ \(S \supset T\) proper superset
*** Cardinality
+ \(|S|\) Cardinality of S or the number of elements in S
*** Universal Set
+ \(U\) is the set containing all other sets (in the problem)
+ universe of discorse
*** Union
+ \(\{a,b,c\} \cup \{c,e\} = \{a,b,c,e\}\)
*** Intersection
+ \(\{a,b,c\} \cap \{c,e\} = \{c\}\)
*** Disjointedness
\(A \cap B = \varnothing\)
*** Set difference
+ \(A - B\)
+ \(\{a,b,c\} - \{c,e\} = \{a, b\}\)
+ Set of all elements in A but not B
+ Compliment with universal set
*** Compliment
+ \(\bar A = U - A\)
*** Symmetric difference
+ \(A \bigoplus B = A \cup B - A \cap B\)
*** Cartesian product
+ \(A \times B = \{(a,b) | a \in A \text{\: and \:} b \in B\}\)
+ \(|A| \times |B| = |A \times B|\)
*** Generalized Union and Intersection
Union or intersection of many sets.

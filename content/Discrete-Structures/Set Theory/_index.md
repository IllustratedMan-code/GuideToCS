## Disproof by Counterexample {#disproof-by-counterexample}

Shows that a conjecture is not true by pointing out an example where the conjecture does not hold.

-   No nickels
-   1 quarter + 5 pennies
-   3 dimes
-   Greedy method is not appropriate with limited change


## Proof by Contradiction {#proof-by-contradiction}

Proof that the opposite cannot be true.


### Square root of 2 is irrational {#square-root-of-2-is-irrational}

-   \\(\sqrt 2 = a/b\\)
-   \\(a/b\\) is simplified
-   a or b or both must be odd (otherwise could be simplified)
-   \\(2 = a^2/b^2\\)
-   \\(a^2 = 2 \* b^2\\)
-   \\(a^2\\) must be even (2 times any number is even)
-   \\(a\\) is even as well (odd times odd is odd)
-   \\(a = 2 \* k\\) where k is a / 2
-   \\(2 = (2 \* k)^2/b^2 \rightarrow b^2 = 2k^2\\)
-   \\(b\\) is also odd by this method
-   \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) cannot be odd
-   \\(\sqrt 2\\) cannot be rational

## Adaptation to environmental factors {#adaptation-to-environmental-factors}

-   Change factors that limit growth (amount of food, composition of air)
-   Change Tolerance Range (Temperature tolerance, ph tolerance )
-   Change Behavior to adapt beyond Range ( avoid cold areas )


## Limiting environmental factors {#limiting-environmental-factors}

-   physical factors (strength, ability to fly)
-   Physical resources
-   Tolerance bounds


## optimality and `Principle of allocation` {#optimality-and-principle-of-allocation}

Adaptation to one challenge may decrease for another. The more an organism adapts to a stable environment (optimality), the less able it is to adapt to new environments that pose new challenges (moving from hot to cold, fresh water to salt water or vice versa)

-   Large beaks make it easier to break large nuts, but harder to eat insects out of trees.
-   Homeostasis allows humans to survive in a variety of environmental conditions, but requires more (is limited by) food.


## Normal Distribution and measures of variation {#normal-distribution-and-measures-of-variation}

Many biological factors rely on modifications to the normal distribution.

-   quantified as a probability or confidence interval (95% of samples fall within this range of values)
-   \\(\text{Sample Variance} = \frac{\sum\_1^n (\bar x - x\_i)^2}{n-1} = s^2\\)
-   \\(\text{Sample Mean} = \frac{\sum\_1^n}{n} = \bar x\\)
-   \\(\text{confidence statistic (percentage)} = 1-\alpha\\)
-   \\(\text{confidence interval} = \bar x \pm t\_{1-\alpha} \* s/\sqrt n\\)
-   \\(\text{Standard Error (Estimate of the mean)} = \frac{s^2}{n}\\)


### Description of the plots used in ecology {#description-of-the-plots-used-in-ecology}

-   y axis refers to the frequency of individuals (higher is more)
-   x axis refers to some limiting factor (food, temperature)
-   Peak refers to the mean of the sample


### P Value {#p-value}

The P value is the probability that the Null hypothesis is true. This value is calculated with a statistical test (t test when using a sample).


#### Example {#example}

-   \\(H\_0 = \text{Cancer is randomly occuring}\\)
-   \\(H\_a = \text{Cancer is caused by radiation damage}\\)
-   \\(P < 0.05\\)
-   There is less than a 5 percent chance that cancer is randomly occurring.

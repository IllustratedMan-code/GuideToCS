## Adaptation to environmental factors {#adaptation-to-environmental-factors}

-   Change factors that limit growth (amount of food, composition of air)
-   Change Tolerance Range (Temperature tolerance, ph tolerance )
-   Change Behavior to adapt beyond Range ( avoid cold areas )


## Limiting environmental factors {#limiting-environmental-factors}

-   physical factors (strength, ability to fly)
-   Physical resources
-   Tolerance bounds


## optimality and `Principle of allocation` {#optimality-and-principle-of-allocation}

Adaptation to one challenge may decrease for another. The more an organism adapts to a stable environment (optimality), the less able it is to adapt to new environments that pose new challenges (moving from hot to cold, fresh water to salt water or vice versa)

-   Large beaks make it easier to break large nuts, but harder to eat insects out of trees.
-   Homeostasis allows humans to survive in a variety of environmental conditions, but requires more (is limited by) food.


## Normal Distribution and measures of variation {#normal-distribution-and-measures-of-variation}

Many biological factors rely on modifications to the normal distribution.

-   quantified as a probability or confidence interval (95% of samples fall within this range of values)
-   \\(\text{Sample Variance} = \frac{\sum\_1^n (\bar x - x\_i)^2}{n-1} = s^2\\)
-   \\(\text{Sample Mean} = \frac{\sum\_1^n}{n} = \bar x\\)
-   \\(\text{confidence statistic (percentage)} = 1-\alpha\\)
-   \\(\text{confidence interval} = \bar x \pm t\_{1-\alpha} \* s/\sqrt n\\)
-   \\(\text{Standard Error (Estimate of the mean)} = \frac{s^2}{n}\\)


### Description of the plots used in ecology {#description-of-the-plots-used-in-ecology}

-   y axis refers to the frequency of individuals (higher is more)
-   x axis refers to some limiting factor (food, temperature)
-   Peak refers to the mean of the sample


### P Value {#p-value}

The P value is the probability that the Null hypothesis is true. This value is calculated with a statistical test (t test when using a sample).


#### Example {#example}

-   \\(H\_0 = \text{Cancer is randomly occuring}\\)
-   \\(H\_a = \text{Cancer is caused by radiation damage}\\)
-   \\(P < 0.05\\)
-   There is less than a 5 percent chance that cancer is randomly occurring.


## behavioral Thermoregulation. {#behavioral-thermoregulation-dot}

Animals will move to areas that are conducive to their optimal temperature range.

-   Snakes bask in the sun to warm up (ectotherms)
-   Humans will go inside (or put on clothes) to warm up (endotherms)
-   Monkeys will bathe in hot springs in cold climates. (endotherms)


## Adaptive radiation {#adaptive-radiation}

The tendency for species to diversify to fill open ecological niches.

-   Early Plants
-   Finches


## Osmoregulation (water stress) and photosynthesis {#osmoregulation--water-stress--and-photosynthesis}

Organisms alter their internal concentration of solute (or consume water) to regulate their internal water content.

-   Skin and scales prevent unintended evaporation of water
-   C3 pathway is shared by all plants (the calvin cycle)
-   C4 pathway allows plants to save water by closing the stomata when necessary.


## Adaptation vs Plasticity {#adaptation-vs-plasticity}

Some animals have larger optimal ranges of physical resources than others (plasticity)

-   Evolution thorugh natural selection adapts organisms to their environments
-   Plasticity refers to the ability of an organism to survive in different environments
-   Humans could be said to have high plasticity due to our tool making
-   Octopi make estensive use of RNA editing sites to alter their expression [Octopus RNA editing sites](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-00612-y) (plasticity?)

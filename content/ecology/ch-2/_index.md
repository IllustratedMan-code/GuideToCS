3.  gene frequencies
4.  genotype
5.  phenotype


## Important terms for the course {#important-terms-for-the-course}

-   `Evolution` is the change of populations (species) over time due to heritable changes.
-   `Natural Selection` is the "selection" of heritable traits due to their fitness
-   `Adaptation` is the tendency for natural selection to select changes most well suited to the environment.
-   `Fitness` is the likelihood that an organism will survive (pass its genes down) in its current environment.


## Mechanisms for evolutionary change {#mechanisms-for-evolutionary-change}

-   Natural Selection
-   Genetic drift
-   Gene Flow
-   Mutation pressure


## Natural section, genetic drift, gene flow {#natural-section-genetic-drift-gene-flow}


### genetic drift {#genetic-drift}

The random change of allele frequency based on non-random mating. Only affects populations with limited populations (non-random mating)


### Gene flow {#gene-flow}

Individuals can move from population to population, or form a new population.
These fluctuations can change the allele frequencies in a population.


#### Isolation {#isolation}

Differentiation is affected by Isolation. Isolation prevents gene flow.


### Hardy Weinberg {#hardy-weinberg}

-   \\(P^2 + 2PQ + Q^2\\)


## Adaptation is an undirected process {#adaptation-is-an-undirected-process}

Traits are not created to adapt to the environment. Traits instead are randomly generated (through mutation) and the traits that are well suited to the environment are selected for.


## Phenotypic Plasticity {#phenotypic-plasticity}

Development of physiological variation among phenotypes induced directly by the environment.

-   Occurs during the development of an individual.
-   Himalayan Rabbits are a good example, they have areas of black fur if born in a cold environment.


## Adaptive landscape {#adaptive-landscape}

An adaptive landscape is a three dimensional plot, where the x and y axis refer to allele frequency and the z axis refers to fitness. "Peaks" and "Valleys" show how different allele frequencies affect fitness and why genetic drift can be helpful for adaptation.


## Red Queen Hypothesis {#red-queen-hypothesis}

Increased fitness in the short term does not always end well for the species.
This discrepancy of fitness between two related organisms (parasites/hosts, predators/prey) is related to generational rate. One of the species in the relationship cannot keep up evolutionarily with its pair species. This may result in extinction of prey or predator or both.

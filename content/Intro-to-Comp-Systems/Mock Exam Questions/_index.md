Question 1 and 2 seem to reference this article:
[8086-8088](/ox-hugo/8086.pdf)


## Q1 {#q1}

If a physical branch target address is 5A230 when CS = 5200, what will it be if the CS = 7800 ?

-   We need to find the offset, where offset + CS(shifted 4 bits) = physical branch target address. CS(C segment register)
-   Offset = Physical branch target address - CS
-   Offset = 5A230 - 52000 = 8230 (hex)

The offset is then used to find the physical branch target adress.

-   78000 + 8230 = 80230 = physical branch target address


## Q2 {#q2}

Given that the EA of a data is 2359 and DS = 490B, what is the PA of data?

-   `EA (effective Address), DS (D segment register), PA(Physical Address)`.

Physical address is given by EA + DS(shifted 4 bits).

-   DS = 490B0 (hex)
-   EA = 2359 (hex)
-   PA = 490B0 + 2359 = 4B409


## Q3 {#q3}

Assuming, W, X, Y and Z as memory addresses. Write a program using any machine sequence that will carry out the following: Z ‚Üê W + (Z-X).

```mips
    .globl main
    .text

main:
    lw $t1, Z #load z into temporary register 1
    lw $t2, X #load x into temporary register 2
    sub $s1, $t1, $t2 #s1 <- t1-t2
    lw $t1, W #load w into temporary register 1
    add $s1, $t1, $s1 #s1 <- t1
    sw $s1, Z # stores s1 into Z

    li $v0, 1 #prints z
    lw $a0, Z
    syscall

    li $v0, 10 #exits
    syscall

Z: .word  12 #arbitrary value
X: .word 10 #arbitrary value
W: .word 5 #arbitrary value
```

## Q4 {#q4}

Assume that the code below is run on a machine with a 2 GHz clock that requires the following number of cycles for each instruction: add, addi, sll, sra take 4cc each,  lw takes 5cc,   bne, beq  take 3cc each. How many seconds will it take to execute this code. The values of registers are $4=0x20, $5= 0x20, $6= 0x30, $7= 0x10.

```mips
    .globl  main
    .text

main:
    sra $6, $6, 2   # changes original value of 0x30 / 2^2  = 0xC
    sll $7, $7, 2 # original value = 0x10, 0x10 * 2^2 = 0x40
    add $8, $0, $0 # sets register 8 to 0
L2: add $12, $4, $8 #marks L2, $12 <- 0x20 + $8, $8 is iterator
    lw  $12, 0($12) # $12 = memory at address of ($12) on stack
    add $9, $0, $0 # $9 = 0;
L1: add $11, $5, $9 #marks L1, $11 = 0x20 + $9, $9 is iterator
    lw  $11, 0($11) #$11 = memory at address of ($11) on stack
    addi $9, $9, 4 #$9 = $9 + 4
    bne $9, $7, L1 # goes to L1 if $9 != $7  0x0 + 0x4 * 0x10 = 0x40 = $9 loop executes 0x10 times
    addi $8, $8, 4 # $8 = $8 + 4
    beq $8, $6, L2 # goes to L2 if $8 == $6 exits before  $8 can equal $6
```


### Instruction definitions {#instruction-definitions}

-   sra (shift right arithmetic) (sra `destination`, `origin`, `shift(in bits)`) rounds down
-   sll (shift left logical) (sll `destination`, `origin`, `shift`)
-   bne (bne r1, r2, branch address) goes to branch address if r1 != r2
-   beq (beq, r1, r2, branch address) goest to branch address if r1 == r2


### Calculate number of clock cycles {#calculate-number-of-clock-cycles}


#### Before loops {#before-loops}

-   sra 4cc
-   sll 4cc
-   add 4cc
-   total = 12cc


#### L2 {#l2}

-   add 4cc
-   lw 5cc
-   add 4cc
-   L1 clocks
-   addi 4cc

-   total = (20cc + L1 clocks)\*1 loop


#### L3 {#l3}

-   add 4cc
-   lw 5cc
-   addi 4ccc
-   bne 3cc
-   total = (16cc \* 16 loops) = 256 clocks


#### Total clocks {#total-clocks}

12cc + 20cc + 256cc = 288cc


### Calculate time {#calculate-time}

288cc/(2\*10^9cc/s) = 1.44 \* 10^-7 seconds

## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Q8 {#q8}

How many 128 x 8 memory chips are needed to provide a memory capacity of 4096 x 16?

-   4096\*16 / 128\*8 = 64


## Q9 {#q9}

Given a 32 x 8 ROM chip with an enable input, show the external connections necessary to construct a 128 x 8 ROM with four chips and a decoder. [Useful Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3vIqPplSdQ)

-   2^5 = 32
-   5 address lines for each ROM
-   128/32 = 4 chips
-   4 outputs on decoder (connected to enable inputs)
-   2^2 = 4
-   2 address lines for the decoder
-   5 + 2 = 7 total lines for complete address
